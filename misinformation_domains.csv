Analysis / Bias
In review, the primary function of the DNC is to advocate, fund and promote Democratic candidates for all levels of office. The bias of the DNC is very clear, they favor the Democratic party and their platform. However, progressive leaning candidates and media organizations have accused the DNC of supporting centrist, establishment, pro-corporate candidates: Tom Perez Stacks the DNC Deck Against Progressives.
The DNC website also publishes news from a moderately liberal perspective that frequently uses loaded emotional language such as this Trump’s Mismanagement Continues To Make The Crisis Worse and this In Latest Briefing, Trump Lies About His Coronavirus Response. In general, the news reported is well sourced to credible media outlets such as the LA Times, NPR and New York Times. However, statements made by the DNC has a poor track record with fact checking.

History
Founded in February 1998, according to it’s about page, MEMRI or Middle East Media Research Institute states its purpose as distributing English translations of Middle Eastern media. MEMRI describes itself as “Independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit, 501(c)3 organization” and they state that they cover “original analysis of political, ideological, intellectual, social, cultural, and religious trends.”
MEMRI is based in Washington DC and its founder is a former Israeli military intelligence officer Yigal Carmon. Memri also launched MEMRI TV news channel which is described by Know your Meme as “the channel has gained much notoriety for its absurd translations of news programs, many of which have spawned photoshops of screenshots showing false or edited subtitles.”

MEMRI is a nonprofit 501(c) organization. Funding is derived from around 250 private donors, including other organizations and foundations. Some donors include The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Inc., The Randolph Foundation, and the John M. Olin Foundation.
Analysis / Bias
According to Source Watch “Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) is a Israeli propaganda organization that selectively translates materials from the Arab/Muslim/Iranian press purportedly demonstrating hostility against Israel/Jews.”
In review, the articles on MEMRI are supposedly direct translations from other languages, however almost all translation favor Israel and denigrate Muslims. According to The Guardian, MEMRI is a pro-Israel propaganda site. MEMRI frequently uses strongly emotional wording such as this: Hamas Political Bureau Member Fathi Hammad Calls On Palestinians All Over The World To Slaughter Jews, Says: If Israel Doesn’t Lift The Siege By Next Friday, We Will Kill The Jews With Explosive Belts And Knives. Again, this story is relying on MEMRI’s translation, which we cannot verify. In general, MEMRI is a pro-Israeli propaganda source.

The Heartland Institute is a nonprofit that has received funding in the past from notable right leaning institutions such as Exxon-Mobil, Charles G. Koch Foundation, and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. In the past, the Heartland Institute listed their donors, however they stopped this practice based on this reasoning: “For many years, we provided a complete list of Heartland’s corporate and foundation donors on this Web site and challenged other think tanks and advocacy groups to do the same. To our knowledge, not a single group followed our lead. However, critics who couldn’t or wouldn’t engage in fair debate over our ideas found the donor list a convenient place to find the names of unpopular companies or foundations, which they used in ad hominem attacks against us. Even reporters from time to time seemed to think reporting the identities of one or two donors–out of a list of hundreds–was a fair way of representing our funding or our motivation in taking the positions expressed in our publications. After much deliberation and with some regret, we now keep confidential the identities of all our donors.” Since they no longer list their donors, we are unable to determine their sources of funding.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Heartland Institute’s primary mission is to advocate for corporations and minimal regulations. For example, they have advocated on behalf of the tobacco industry claiming that “We argue that the (smoking) risks are exaggerated by the public health community to justify their calls for more regulations on businesses and higher taxes on smokers, and that the risk of adverse health effects from second-hand smoke is dramatically less than for active smoking, with many studies finding no adverse health effects at all. These positions are supported by many prominent scientists and virtually all free-market think tanks.” While Heartland may be able to find a few scientists and virtually all free-market think tanks (who aren’t scientists) to claim that second hand smoke is not very harmful, that goes completely against the consensus of the science.
The Heartland Institute is a leading supporter in human influenced climate change denial and when it comes to climate change information, they have made numerous false or misleading claims. They have also made false claims when it comes to other political issues. Here is a partial list of their numerous failed fact checks.
Overall, we rate the Heartland Institute Right Biased and Questionable based on promotion of anti-science propaganda, lack of transparency with funding, and more than 5 failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. (7/19/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 9/26/2019)

History
The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is a non-profit tax exempt organization in the United States that advocates changes in U.S. immigration policy that they believe would result in significant reductions in immigration, both legal and illegal.  
FAIR was founded in 1979 by the ophthalmologist John Tanton, former historian of labor movements and director of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions Otis L. Graham, Jr. and Sidney Swensrud, a former chairman of Gulf Oil. John Tanton is the founder of, or involved in the creation of several Anti-Immigration groups that include Numbers USA and the Center for Immigration Studies, that is collectively known as the John Tanton Network. John Tanton believes maintaining an American culture requires “a European-American majority,” and according to the Southern Poverty Law Center he is a prominent figure in the white-nationalist movement.  
The current President of FAIR is Dan Stein.
Funded by / Ownership
According to their website “The Federation for American Immigration Reform is an independent, non-profit research organization.” FAIR does not disclose financial information on the website. However, one of the most prominent donors over the last 20+ years is the Colcom Foundation, established in 1996 by the late heiress Cordelia Scaife May. According to Inside Philanthropy, “Colcom’s top beneficiaries include every one of Tanton’s anti-immigration groups, including FAIR (over $18 million), NumbersUSA (over $17 million), Tanton’s Social Contract Press (over $10 million), and CIS (over $8 million). Further, “Between 1985 and 1994, FAIR received around $1.2 million in grants from the Pioneer Fund. The Pioneer Fund is a eugenicist organization that was started in 1937 by men close to the Nazi regime who wanted to pursue “race betterment” by promoting the genetic lines of American whites. FAIR has a donation link on their website.
Analysis / Bias
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center “The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is a group with one mission: to severely limit immigration into the United States. Although FAIR maintains a veneer of legitimacy that has allowed its principles to testify in Congress and lobby the federal government, this veneer hides much ugliness.  Further, FAIR has ties to white supremacist groups. 
In review, FAIR publishes articles and research that is currently Pro-Trump, such as this: Trump Administration Immigration Accomplishments. They also routinely denigrate immigrants as criminals or dangerous for America such as these: Examples of Serious Crimes By Illegal Aliens and conspiracies such as Could Uncontrolled Immigration Expose Us to a Public Health Crisis? This latter article is sourced to wide range of Questionable far right sources such as Breitbart, Gatestone Institute and Judicial Watch. 
According the right leaning Cato Institute, FAIR has published questionable research that is “fatally flawed.” Cato reports: “Its recent report, ‘The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers (2017)’ by Matthew O’Brien, Spencer Raley, and Jack Martin, estimates that the net fiscal costs of illegal immigration to U.S. taxpayers is $116 billion. FAIR’s report reaches that conclusion by vastly overstating the costs of illegal immigration, undercounting the tax revenue they generate, inflating the number of illegal immigrants, counting millions of U.S. citizens as illegal immigrants, and by concocting a method of estimating the fiscal costs that is rejected by all economists who work on this subject.
A factual search reveals a poor track record with fact checkers.
Overall, we rate FAIR Questionable based on Extreme Right Wing Bias as it relates to immigration, promotion of propaganda and conspiracies, as well as having connections to documented Hate Groups. (9/7/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 1/06/2019)

Mehmet Cengiz Öz, better known as Dr. Oz, is a Turkish-American cardiothoracic surgeon, Columbia University professor, author, and television personality. He is a proponent of alternative medicine, and has been criticized by physicians, government officials, and publications for giving non-scientific advice and promoting pseudoscience. In 2014 the British Medical Journal examined over 400 medical or health recommendations from 40 episodes of his program and found that only 46% of his claims were supported by reputable research, while 15% of his claims contradicted medical research and the remainder of Oz’s advice were either vague or unsupported by research.

In review, both the Dr. Oz television show and his website routinely promote pseudoscience. Some examples are miracle weight loss products, natural teeth whitening mixtures that do not work, and promotion of anti-GMO propaganda. In 2012, Dr. Oz won James Randi’s “The Pigasus Award for Refusal to Face Reality” for his continued promotion of “quack medical practices, paranormal belief, and pseudoscience.” Further, Dr. Oz has promoted one of the worst purveyors of Pseudoscience, Joseph Mercola on his TV show.
As of early April 2020, Dr. Oz frequently appears on the Sean Hannity radio program (Far right wing) promoting hydroxychloroquine to fight Covid-19. However, there is not sufficient evidence to prove its effectiveness or safety.

Analysis / Bias
The Washington Times, although praised by conservative political leaders, has also been criticized for being the mouthpiece of the Unification Church. The Washington Times also has a strong pro- Christian bias, with a whole section dedicated to the Bible. They have also published articles that criticize left-leaning Christians such as this: “George Soros and his ‘rented evangelicals’ outed by Christian leaders.”
In review, The Washington Times utilizes emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as “Gowdy puts Comey on blast after FBI ex-chief’s snarky ‘search for the truth’ tweet” and “NBC News’ Mika Brzezinski problem.” When it comes to sourcing, The Washington Times re-publishes articles from the least biased Associated Press and occasionally utilizes credible sources such as Refinery29. In examining several articles, we found that The Times either does not source information at all, or they simply link back to themselves (internal linking) to information that is not relevant to the article. This article is a good example of internal linking: “Mueller: FBI did not mislead Flynn into lying.” Internal linking is a technique used to increase page views and improve SEO, thereby increasing advertising revenue. There is nothing wrong with internal linking if the link relates to relevant information, but in the case of The Times, it does not.
When evaluating how The Times covers science, we found they published an analysis/opinion piece by L. Todd Wood that promotes a climate change conspiracy theory: “global warming and then the climate change narrative was cooked up by America’s adversaries to enable our enemies to eventually dominate us.” Further, according to IFCN fact checker Climate Feedback, The Washington Times published an article with very low scientific credibility. However, when covering straight news on climate change they report accurately as seen in this article: “Trump admin releases National Climate Assessment with dire warnings.”
A factual search reveals that The Washington Times has failed numerous fact checks.
Although the Washington Times has a very strong right editorial bias, they report straight news with a much lower bias. Therefore, we rate them Right-Center biased overall. We also rate them questionable and factually mixed due to poor sourcing, holding editorial positions that are contrary to scientific consensus, and numerous failed fact checks.

Notes: Got Questions is an online fundamentalist Christian ministry which answers questions surrounding Christian doctrines. It was founded by S. Michael Houdmann in February 2002. The website claims to have over 500,000 questions answered. Overall, Got Questions denies evolution, promotes Young Earth Creationism and denies anthropogenic global warming. The Ministry holds Christian Right views such as abortion is murder and condemnation of homosexuality. In summary, this source answers questions based on the Bible, which is not a scientific document and therefore has questionable facts. (D. Van Zandt 8/25/2017)

Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth (AE911Truth) is an American non-profit organization of architects and engineers who dispute the results of official investigations into the September 11 attacks, including the 9/11 Commission Report. Founded in 2006, the group calls for “a truly independent investigation” into the September 11 attacks as they believe government agency investigations into the collapse of the World Trade Center have not addressed what it calls “massive evidence for explosive demolition.”

The Middle East Forum (MEF) is an American conservative think tank founded in 1990 by Daniel Pipes, who serves as its president. According to their mission statement “The Middle East Forum promotes American interests in the Middle East and protects Western values from Middle Eastern threats.”
The Middle East Forum also publishes the following:
Middle East Quarterly – a quarterly journal devoted to Middle Eastern affairs.
Campus Watch – identifies what it finds to be the five major problems in the teaching of Middle Eastern studies at American universities: “analytical failures, the mixing of politics with scholarship, intolerance of alternative views, apologetics, and the abuse of power over students.”
Islamist Watch – seeks to educate the government, media, religious institutions, the academy, and the business world about lawful Islamism.
The Legal Project – protects researchers, analysts, and activists who work on radical Islam and related topics from predatory lawsuits designed to silence their exercise of free speech.

In review, The Middle East Forum is an anti-Islamist and strongly pro-Israel group. They often use moderately loaded wording in their headlines such as this: Migration to Europe Becomes a Crisis and they rarely provide hyperlinked sourcing. The Middle East Forum also republishes articles from right leaning sources such as the Washington Times and the Gatestone Institute.
The Middle East Forum has been placed on the Hate Watch list by the Southern Poverty Law Center for financing a rally in London last month in support of English far-right provocateur Tommy Robinson. The MEF also bankrolled Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar’s trip to the U.K. to attend the rally for the jailed far-right activist.
In response to the rally, on June 19, 2018 a letter was published in The Guardian with over 50 signatories, including British parliamentarians, condemning the rally calling it a “resurgent of the racist right.”
“The racist right are using Robinson to reorganize,” the letter states. “Nazi salutes and Islamophobia were at the centre of the mobilisation. This is the first serious attempt since the collapse of the English Defence League (EDL) to develop a racist street movement and give it a political form.”
Further, the founder and President of the Middle East Forum, Daniel Pipes is listed as an Islamophobic Individual by CAIR.

Autism Speaks is an autism advocacy organization in the United States that sponsors autism research and conducts awareness and outreach activities aimed at families, governments, and the public. Autism Speaks is an organization that raises tens of millions of dollars each year by hosting walks and star-studded events like an annual concert in Hollywood called Light Up the Blues. While Autism Speaks is one of the largest and most influential Autism groups they are not without controversy. Up until recently they promoted anti-vaccination propaganda based on the false notion that vaxx is a risk factor for autism. This goes 100% against the consensus of science. Thankfully, they have changed their position stating: “have not found a link between vaccines and autism,” and that they “strongly encourage parents to have their children vaccinated for protection against serious disease.” Another significant controversy is the board of Autism Speaks does not have a single person with autism representing the organization. This has caused persons with autism to form counter groups and protest this organizations leadership.

Analysis / Bias
In review, I Hate the Media publishes very little original content, but rather is more of a news curation service. A typical post on the blog consists of a link to a another source with a biased opinion attached to it, such as this: Homeless vet, couple allegedly made up story for GoFundMe scam. “Remember folks, if it sounds too good to be good it may be a ripoff. Oh, and what is it about people with Bobbitt for a last name?”
While I Hate the Media links to a variety of mostly right and some left leaning sights the context of the message is always pro-right. Here is an example of extreme right wing bias that links to a known questionable source that has failed numerous fact checks: Trump is correct, forest mismanagement contributed to California wildfire devastation. “Short version. Democrats and Greentards: “Like wow man, we just had a bong hit and got a great idea man. Let’s just let the forests grow wild, like back to Mother Nature man.” IHTM: “Um, excuse us, but forest fires are part of Mother Nature dummy. Have another bong hit.” Of course their excuse is the usual suspect – global warming did it.”
When it comes to the sources they link to, there are many that come from far right and questionable sources, such as the Conservative Tribune and Infowars. In general, not all content on this blog is Questionable. There are many stories that are 100% credible, but always spun with a biased narrative before leading to the article.

Newsmax is owned by Christopher Ruddy who is the CEO of Newsmax Media. Newsmax is funded through advertising and via a paid subscription to their platinum plan, which allows more access to content.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsmax has a category on their side bar called Around the Web, which is nothing more than deceptive advertising that looks like news links and leads to fake pseudo-science information and products. For example: “Suffer with Low Energy, Weight Gain & Fatigue”, which leads to a new website promoting products. In another category called Specials, they publish news with sensational headlines such as: “Nobel Prize Winning Discovery Makes Your Cells Nearly “Immortal” SPECIAL: New way to grow biologically younger,“ which again leads to an advertisement.
When reporting real news, Newsmax uses minimally loaded words in their headlines and articles such as “NYT: Growing Puerto Rican Population Could Offset GOP Cubans” and moderately loaded: “FEMA’s Long: No Time For San Juan Mayor’s ‘Political Noise’. Newsmax also aggregates news stories from credible sources such as Reuters and the AP. Editorially, Newsmax leans strongly right, with most editorials favoring the right, such as “Could Google Lose the Left?”, which first appeared in the right biased Conservative Review.
When it comes to science, Newsmax does not always align with the consensus of experts in the given field. For example, they often promote that there is “no global warming“, which is simply untrue.
A factual search reveals that Newsmax has not failed a fact check when it comes to news reporting.

History
Breitbart News is a conservative news and opinion website founded in 2007 by Andrew Breitbart (1969–2012). He was a conservative commentator and entrepreneur “a former liberal from Los Angeles who became a conservative” wrote Jonah Engel Bromwich of the NY Times. Breitbart News under his leadership generated news coverage that was praised by the right for its populist, anti-establishment voice, on the left however, he was also accused of being a provocateur and misleading. Andrew Breitbart also co-founded the Huffington Post.
After Andrew Breitbart died in 2012, former investment banker for Goldman Sachs, Stephen Bannon became the executive chairman of Breitbart. Under Bannon the website became more nationalist and a vocal outlet of the alt-right movement. According to Sarah Posner from Mother Jones, during her interview with Bannon, he described Breitbart News as “a platform to the alt-right.” Bannon, who was chief executive of the Trump campaign, and then White House chief strategist for seven months before returning to Breitbart News, had stepped down from his position at Breitbart in 2018.

Larry Solov is the co-founder and CEO of Breitbart News and Alex Marlow serves as editor-in-chief.
In October 2018, Breitbart was banned as a reliable source in Wikipedia. Further, they were added as a reliable news source to Facebook’s new news initiative. This decision was met by harsh criticism by several media outlets, including Media Bias Fact Check.

Under the Big Hollywood section they publish tabloid stories such as “Fashion Notes: Melania Trump is Posh and Proper for Final Day in England” utilizing fashion sources such as farfetch.com
A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 7% of Breitbart’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 14% Mixed and 79% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that Breitbart is heavily preferred by a more conservative audience.
In general, the majority of published stories favor the right and are highly pro-Trump in tone and story selection.

Notes: The American Principles Project (APP) is a 501(c)(3) think tank founded in 2009 by Robert George, Jeff Bell, and Frank Cannon. APP promotes a combination of libertarian and social conservative policies. It is chaired by Sean Fieler.
While opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage, APP largely focuses on promoting immigration reform, opposing the Common Core curriculum, and defending religious liberty (against LGBTQ and abortion). They have also advocated for monetary reform by suggesting a return to the gold standard.
In reviewing the website the primary mission according to their articles is to suppress women’s rights through banning abortion and limiting the freedom and liberty of LGBTQ. They also use misleading information such as the debunked video of Planned Parenthood selling baby parts. The Southern Poverty Law Center has accused American Principles Project of promoting conspiracies, but has not formally labeled them a hate group.

Analysis / Bias
In review, MindBodyGreen is a typical Mixed factual Pseudoscience website. They publish plenty of credible articles that do not make fantastic claims, but within these there are those that claim herbs prevent cancer and cure disease. For example, in this article the headline reads that Avacodos may cure Leukemia: Avocados Could Hold The Key To Curing Leukemia. A review of the article shows this to be misleading. Avocados are a great food source and loaded with plenty of nutrients, but this misleading headline does not match the article. MindBodyGreen also does not support the consensus of science when it comes to GMO’s as most articles paint them in a negative light. Interestingly, they do support the consensus of science with Climate Change. We call this selective science that may be financially or politically biased. Other articles promote incredible benefits from herbs, diets and exercise routines that simply are not validated through peer reviewed science.

In review, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) is a quackery level anti-vaccination organization. The entire premise of the website is to encourage parents and adults not to vaccinate due to perceived dangers that are not accepted by science, as well as promoting propaganda campaigns such as displaying billboards along highways. Further, NVIC also claims a partnership with known pseudoscience purveyor, Joseph Mercola. This source also promotes the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism.

According to Ehud Rosen, MEMO generally supports Islamist positions within Palestinian politics. According to Andrew Gilligan, the Middle East Monitor promotes a strongly pro-Muslim Brotherhood and pro-Hamas viewpoint. Anshel Pfeffer described MEMO as a “conspiracy theory-peddling anti-Israel organisation”. Our review shows that the Middle East Monitor has a left wing bias in the use of loaded words and also in story choices that promote Islamic positions. We could not find any instances of the Middle East Monitor failing fact checks, but they do sometimes source to questionable media outlets and hence garner a Mixed factual rating.

A factual search reveals several failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. Here are a select few out of dozens.

We especially focus on the impact of family breakdown on children: understanding it, healing it, ending it.” The founder is Dr. Jennifer Roback Morse.
In review, the Ruth Institute is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The Ruth Institute was originally a project of the anti-LGBT National Organization for Marriage (NOM), created to conduct youth outreach, and to warn young people about the dangers of divorce, sexual promiscuity, and, especially, to recruit them in the fight to block the legalization of gay marriage.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Now The End Begins is a far right Christian conspiracy website. Almost all stories on the website favor the right and usually falsely denigrate the left. Further, most stories are fake, such as this one: PROOF OF GEORGE SOROS NAZI PAST FINALLY COMES TO LIGHT WITH DISCOVERY OF FORGOTTEN INTERVIEW. The reality is Soros was a 14 year old Jew, hiding from the Nazi’s at that time. Virtually, every story on this website is either misleading or fake such as this: ONE OF CONVICTED PEDOPHILE JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S SEX SLAVES SAYS SHE PERSONALLY SAW FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON ON ‘ORGY ISLAND’ WITH TWO YOUNG GIRLS. This is an unproven claim. Further, Now The End Begins fails to mention President Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein, which is confirmed. This is because Now the End Begins glorifies President Trump as a savior. In general, all stories favor the extreme right, with many anti-immigration stories as well as routinely reporting negatively on Islam. When it comes to science they chock climate change up to Jesus.

Analysis / Bias
In review, VacTruth.com does not even attempt to be a credible science website, with every article either portraying vaccines negatively or outright being false and opposed to the consensus of science. For example, the article New Research Proves Brains of Children with Autism are Loaded with Aluminum has been thoroughly debunked by scientists. This article, Baby Foreskin Is Being Used To Make Vaccines, is another that is completely false. In general, there is very little information on this website that is verified as true.

In general, most international news stories on RT are factual and relate to true events, however there are occasional pieces that spin these facts into a different narrative, that is misleading. Another concerning aspect of RT is they do not list author information for articles published on the website. This presents a lack of transparency that makes it difficult to verify information.

Sputnik is a Russian news agency and radio broadcaster which publishes online stories and radio shows, as well as videos. In 2013, via a presidential decree by Vladimir Putin, the radio station Voice of Russia and RIA Novosti news service was abolished and replaced by Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today, not to be confused with RT). In 2014, Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today) launched Sputnik and conservative news anchor, Dmitry Kiselyov was appointed as Director General of Rossiya Segodnya. Kiselyov is known for ultra conservative views and anti-gay comments.
According to their about page, Sputnik describes itself as “The agency covers global political and economic news targeting an international audience.” Sputnik is based in Moscow.

Funded by / Ownership
Sputnik is owned and funded by the Russian Government to promote Russia’s image abroad. The Sputnik news service produces over 1,500 news items daily and around the clock that are available to subscribers via the web terminal and mobile app. The website also serves online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
Sputnik is often accused of reporting ‘fake news, spreading misinformation and being a “Kremlin Propaganda Machine” by European and American media outlets. In 2017, the FBI launched an investigation into Sputnik for a potential violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).
In review, Sputnik’s coverage regarding American Politics leans right and is consistently pro-Trump: “FBI Memo Implies Dossier on Trump Russian Collusion Funded by Clinton.” Sputnik also frequently uses strongly loaded emotional wording in headlines such as this: “WATCH: Philly’s New Year Parade Act Sees Trump, Putin Fight Over ‘Pee Tape’”
Sputnik routinely publishes articles that promote conspiracy theories such as those about the murder of Seth Rich, which fact checker Snopes has debunked. Sputnik also employs conspiracy theorists such as former Breitbart writer Lee Stranahan, who was hired as co-host of a radio show for Sputnik Radio, called “Fault Lines with Nixon and Stranahan”. Lee Stranahan also appears as a guest on Alex Jones’ Infowars program, which is famous for promoting outrageous right-wing conspiracies.
When it comes to sourcing, Sputnik occasionally uses credible sources such as Reuters and CNN, however they also source to known conspiracy sites such as Infowars: “InfoWars Alex Jones Talks Brexit, Freedom of Speech in US, Political Correctness” and “Anonymous Exposes UK’s Hybrid Warfare Project”. Further, they frequently source to their own articles or they use large blocks of quotes.
According to Google Fact Check Explorer, Sputnik has a very poor fact check record with 17 misleading or false claims. Below is a small sampling of their many failed fact checks:
Sputnik Falsely Blames India’s Sell-Off of US Securities on ‘Weaponization of the Dollar’ – FALSE
Sputnik Falsely Accuses UN of Supporting the White Helmet Disinfo Campaign Sputnik, Itself, Spreads – FALSE
Sputnik and Zvezda Falsely Claim Hitler’s Mein Kampf is more popular than Harry Potter in Latvia – FALSE
Is the US Evacuating IS Members from Syria? – FALSE
Sputnik: Nevada Declared ‘State of Emergency’ Over Marijuana Shortage – FALSE

Sputnik is often accused of reporting ‘fake news, spreading misinformation and being a “Kremlin Propaganda Machine” by European and American media outlets. In 2017, the FBI launched an investigation into Sputnik for a potential violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).
In review, Sputnik’s coverage regarding American Politics leans right and is consistently pro-Trump: “FBI Memo Implies Dossier on Trump Russian Collusion Funded by Clinton.” Sputnik also frequently uses strongly loaded emotional wording in headlines such as this: “WATCH: Philly’s New Year Parade Act Sees Trump, Putin Fight Over ‘Pee Tape’”
Sputnik routinely publishes articles that promote conspiracy theories such as those about the murder of Seth Rich, which fact checker Snopes has debunked. Sputnik also employs conspiracy theorists such as former Breitbart writer Lee Stranahan, who was hired as co-host of a radio show for Sputnik Radio, called “Fault Lines with Nixon and Stranahan”. Lee Stranahan also appears as a guest on Alex Jones’ Infowars program, which is famous for promoting outrageous right-wing conspiracies.
When it comes to sourcing, Sputnik occasionally uses credible sources such as Reuters and CNN, however they also source to known conspiracy sites such as Infowars: “InfoWars Alex Jones Talks Brexit, Freedom of Speech in US, Political Correctness” and “Anonymous Exposes UK’s Hybrid Warfare Project”. Further, they frequently source to their own articles or they use large blocks of quotes.
According to Google Fact Check Explorer, Sputnik has a very poor fact check record with 17 misleading or false claims. Below is a small sampling of their many failed fact checks:

History
Founded in February 2005, USAWatchdog.com is the website of former CNN journalist, Greg Hunter. According to their about page “the site will keep an eye on the government, your financial interests and cut through the media spin.” Greg Hunter spent nearly 9 years as a network and investigative correspondent.

Analysis / Bias
In reviewing the website it is hard to imagine that a once credible journalist could support and write for a tin foil hat conspiracy website such as this. The primary conspiracies promoted on this website are Geoengineering and Chemtrails. There is also promotion of 9-11 conspiracies.  Further, Greg Hunter lists his favorite websites, which reads like a who’s who of conspiracy and questionable sources. USAWatchdog.com also reports financial news that is generally credible, though again they sometimes promote economic conspiracies that they claim will lead to WW III.

IRIB is state-owned but independent of the Iranian government in its management, and is the only legal TV and radio broadcaster inside Iran. Press TV’s headquarters are located in Tehran.
The stated mission of network is best summarized by Press TV CEO Mohammad Sarafraz when he said at a press conference that, “Since September 11, Western bias has divided the media into two camps: those that favor their policies make up one group and the rest of the media are attached to radical Islamic groups like Al-Qaeda. We want to show that there is a different view. Iran, and the Shi’as in particular, have become a focal point of world propaganda. From the media point of view, we are trying to give a second eye to Western audiences.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, SGT Report is a conspiracy website that primarily reports on the impending meltdown of the economy and the end of the US Dollar as the world’s reserve currency. SGT Report also covers politics with a far right bias that always favors the right and is typically conspiratorial. For example: Donna Brazile and DC Mayor at Hospital With Seth Rich? The source for this story is the Official Hagmann Report, which appears to be an unknown conspiracy based YouTube Channel.
Besides foretelling impending economic doom, this site also promotes the New World Order conspiracy theory: THE VATICAN NWO AGENDA & PROPHECY EXPOSED.

Until 2015, conservative radio and TV commentator Erick Erickson was editor-in-chief. The website does not have an about page and does not list a current editor.  In 2019, three senior contributors for RedState resigned, after they noticed that articles critical of President Trump, were not promoted via social media. In an article for The Bulwark.com, titled Why We Are Quitting RedState, Kimberly Ross, and Andrea Ruth stated that “it’s hard not to note the irony that Salem Media, a company that targets “audiences interested in Christian and family-themed content and conservative values,” threw its full support behind Donald Trump, a thrice-married lying philanderer who utilized bankruptcy laws and debt to con tenants and contractors out of their money. Salem now promotes anyone who is pro-Trump, even if those people gleefully flout Christian principles.”",,Far Right,1.0

Reporters Without Borders has reported Iran as “One of the most oppressive countries” According to a Reporters Without Borders 2019 report, Iran ranks 170 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
According to their about page “International daily newspaper, Tehran Times with more than three decades of its publication is affiliated with MNA.” The Tehran Times is known as a Pro-Government media outlet. The President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani has moved to the left, placing himself with the reformists during the elections, but he is still the leader of the Moderation and Development Party, which is classified as “moderate reformists” “modernist right” or “Republican Right.”
In review, the content of headlines and articles uses loaded words pertaining to national news such as “US ‘failed global leader’ after USSR collapse” and “Jewish MP says Iranian Jews ready, united to defend Iran.”  Further, they poorly source their articles by either heavily quoting or utilizing factually mixed right biased Iranian sources such as Tasnim, Tehran Times and Russian propaganda news media company Sputnik News.
In general, Mehr is a right leaning pro-Government propaganda outlet that is not always factual.

CBN now serves mainly as a production company for The 700 Club, and four other syndicated shows: CBN NewsWatch, Christian World News, 700 Club Interactive and The Brody File, a news-analysis program hosted by political journalist David Brody.

Analysis / Bias
In review, CBN News combines both secular and religious news with a strong christian right bias. There is moderate use of loaded emotional language such as this: Half of Pastors Worry They’ll Offend Someone if They Preach on Controversial Topics. This story is appropriately sourced to credible media such as CBS News. Editorially CBN holds right leaning view points and reports favorably on President Trump. When it comes to science, CBN holds a skeptical view of climate change and evolution.
CBN also features a TV program called the 700 Club, with Pat Robertson serving as host. Pat Robertson has made numerous false claims and promoted conspiracy theories such as claiming that natural disasters occur due to gay immoral acts. Below is a short list of failed fact checks by Pat Robertson.
Margaret Sanger “wanted a black Christian leader to be like a Judas goat and lead the blacks to genocide. Remember that? And they picked Martin Luther King as their spokesman.” – Pants of Fire
President Barack Obama attended  “an Islamic madrassa.” – Mostly False
Pat Robertson said the feminist agenda encourages women to “kill their children, practice witchcraft, and become lesbians.” – Correct Attribution
The SPLC has also reported on Pat Robertson making statements that they consider hate speech.
Overall, we rate the Christian Broadcasting Network a right leaning promoter of conspiracy theories via Pat Robertson on the 700 Club. CBN News however, mostly reports accurate news that sometimes does not align with science. (D. Van Zandt 3/24/2017) Updated (4/13/2019)

Founded in 2010, The Other 98% describe themselves via their about page as “50% Media Lab. 50% Direct Action Crew. 100% Committed to fighting Trump’s Agenda.” The Other 98% is a non-profit activist group that are “tired of corporate control of our government, our institutions, and our planet.” Their primary mission is to get money out of politics and reduce corporate influence.

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Other 98% has very strong left wing bias through story selection and political affiliation that favors the left. There is significant use of loaded language such as this: If you want Trump to deport DACA kids, you’re not a patriotic Christian, you’re an asshole. When it comes to sourcing of information there is very little hyperlinking, therefore it is difficult to determine the credibility and if their reporting is factual. In short, this is a propaganda source that tends to mislead, especially via social media through the sharing of inaccurate memes.
A factual search reveals numerous failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. Here is a short sampling of a few of them:

History
Founded in 2011, World Truth TV is a conspiracy and pseudoscience website. According to their about page the blogs purpose is to serve “sacred knowledge” that the author has discovered. The primary author appears to be someone named Eddie, but there is a lack of transparency, so the editor and owner’s name is unknown.

Funded by / Ownership
The website is presumably owned by “Eddie” and revenue derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, World Truth TV is an over the top pseudoscience and conspiracy website. For example, they promote that the earth is flat, claim that soldiers can become invisible, as well as old classics such as chemtrails, reptilian aliens, anti-vaccination propaganda and 9/11 as an inside job. In general, if you are looking for truth, go elsewhere.  It isn’t here. World Truth TV promotes crazy conspiracies and ridiculous science. The owner does not disclose his intentions, but if this is serious, that is just, well, crazy…

History
Launched in 2009, Zero Hedge is a finance blog founded by Colin Lokey also known with the pseudonym “Tyler Durden,” Daniel Ivandjiiski, and Tim Backshall. According to a Bloomberg Interview the Zero Hedge founders/authors were anonymous until 2016. A Professional Service Subscription is required to read the rest of the interview from Bloomberg, however a New Yorker article also covered their history.
Zero Hedge wrote a rebuttal article regarding the Bloomberg interview that can be found here. A quote from the rebuttal reads: “Zero Hedge hired Colin when he approached us over a year ago begging for a job after he was fired with cause from Seeking Alpha, following a fight with a co-worker.”
Funded by / Ownership
The website is registered in Bulgaria under the name Georgi Georgiev, a business partner of Krassimir Ivandjiiski.
According to Rationalwiki the only writer “conclusively” identified is “Dan Ivandjiiski, who conducts public interviews on behalf of Zero Hedge.” The blog generates revenue from online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In a quote from the above New Yorker article they summarize the political stance of the blog, which Lokey told Bloomberg is: “Russia=good. Obama=idiot. Bashar al-Assad=benevolent leader. John Kerry= dunce. Vladimir Putin=greatest leader in the history of statecraft.”
Zero Hedge’s content has been classified as “alt-right” and has been criticized for presenting conspiracy theories.
In review, Zero Hedge publishes pro-right wing/Trump articles such as Pat Buchanan: “Trump Calls Off Cold War II.” As well as fake news stories regarding liberals: Anti-Trump Protesters Bused Into Austin, Chicago.
Editorial content is written under the pseudonym Tyler Durden and usually focuses on conspiracies related to economic collapse. Zero Hedge sources to factually mixed think tanks such as the The Mises Institute, which promotes Austrian (Anarcho-Capitalism) economics.
A factual search reveals a terrible track record with IFCN fact checkers. Below is just a small sample of the numerous failed fact checks by Zero Hedge.
Says China “stole Coronavirus from Canada and weaponized it into a Bioweapon.” – False
Is a Craigslist ad proof that counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally were “paid to make chaos”? – False

Media Roots does not disclose clearly their ownership, however it appears Abby Martin is the owner. The website does not disclose funding sources, but they do provide a donation link on their website.
Analysis / Bias
Media Roots utilizes strong loaded words and some of their articles are poorly sourced such as “Hillary Clinton’s Business of Corporate Shilling & War Making.” However, some of their articles are sourced to credible news media such as The Guardian and Bloomberg. Media Roots has a far left political bias with support for socialism and most articles on their website favor the left. While many articles are factual, Media Roots also promotes Vaccine and GMO propaganda as well as 9/11 conspiracy theories.

Founded in 1997, World Net Daily or WND is a politically conservative news and opinion website. WND was founded by Joseph Farah, who also serves as editor-in-chief. WND also publishes books under the imprint WND Books.

Analysis / Bias
Based on reviews by all of our researchers, WND is a Questionable online news source that has a far right bias and dabbles in right wing conspiracies such as President Obama’s birth certificate. They also use misleading clickbait headlines that do not always match the content of the article (See M. Allen’s review below). WND also has a very poor track record with fact checkers:
Several different media outlets have criticized WND for both promotion of white nationalism and peddling conspiracy theories. For example, the Washington Post and Columbia Journalism Review has written articles describing WND as Far Right and Alt Right. Further, The Southern Poverty Law Center labels WorldNetDaily as an antigovernment extremist group. (D. Van Zandt 6/19/2016) Updated (12/16/2018). Below is the detailed reviews of each researcher.
WND is deceptive in that their news articles appear moderate and not overtly sensational. However, Snopes has slammed them on many an occasion for parsing of facts, and using inaccurate data. In my opinion, this site with respect to news, is pretty deceiving as on their outward appearances seem well-balanced (scam ads notwithstanding). When you take a look at their Opinion page, their true colors are more evident. This is not a reliable site by any measure for news, and the rest of the site is pretty much a rag. (F. Locke Siewert (2/25/2017)
WND is a decidedly right biased site that does carry some center and slightly left content. This is through linking to reports from less biased sources. For example: The story regarding Black students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The actual article is a fairly well balanced look at the issue by Todd Richmond of the Associated Press. The lead-in line WND used for the article was somewhat misleading, however. By using white supremacists in quotes it seems to imply that it isn’t a factor in the students demands when it is. Where the real bias on the site is evident is on the editorial pages and staff generated articles. Although mostly factual, the wording is heavily weighted and misleading. Carrying some moderate content is not enough, balanced against the editorial stance, to rate WND anything other than right biased and Questionable. (D. Kelley 2/25/2017)
WND is far right/alt-right. This story just came out.  Direct quote “The story, nevertheless, was issued by the AP, which explained it obtained an 11-page document that “calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana.”

The issue here is it doesn’t link to the source but another news outlet that is using the source that then links to the source there.  This is something you might find in a typical badly cited essay in college.  Always cite original sources when referencing material.
Second issue in article –
“On Thursday, activists protesting Trump’s effort to enforce immigration law carried out a “Day Without Immigrants” protest in which immigrants were to stay home from work or school.
In Denver, some parents left work to take lunch to their children in public schools when the lunchroom workers took part in the protest.”
This is minor but it shows a significant downplay of how wide spread and national the “Day Without Immigrants” was. It shows clear bias in how they view said protest when you marginalize like this. Better solution is to not reference it at all to limit bias in reporting.
Screen capture of their headlines as of 2/17/2017

In these headlines we can see what they want to show the viewer first and what bias may or may not exist here.
Firstly the “PUNKED! Congresswoman Falls For ‘Russian Hacking’ Prank” article is the same one seen on every right leaning website out there, but not picked up by Fox or even Breitbart as of yet.  It links only to a Youtube channel. The same group of Russian “Prankstars” also called Sen. McCain.  If anybody in this country has ever tried to call a US Rep or US Senator should know, you’ll be lucky to speak to any humans.
This article is with bias against liberals however, it is sourced accurately and the quotes are accurate.  Again I take issue with them citing a questionable source like Breitbart which is just citing the actual study. Which they should link directly too.

This image shows the Breitbart link but fails to direct link to the study – the site goes on to deride the lack of teaching US History in history course work throughout many “elite” colleges around the country. Ironically, they fail to follow a standard referencing practice you might learn at one of those colleges of citing primary sources only.
This article links to the Washington Times.  This particular article is decent in it’s reporting. There was a study done, now in the Washington Times they reference other entities that decry said report about the illegal registrations. The ODC poll was used  in conjunction with a separate poll by The National Hispanic Survey.  As per the article: “Inside the poll is a page devoted to voter profiles. Of the randomly selected sample of 800 Hispanics, 56 percent, or 448, said they were non-citizens, and of those, 13 percent said they were registered to vote. The 448 would presumably be a mix of illegal immigrants and non-citizens who are in the U.S. legally, such as visa holders or permanent residents”. As one can see from this their use of the poll is an extremely small sample set to gauge a very broad accusation.  However this is just reporting what is being talked about and not making assumptions either way.  It could be argued either way that the poll is bad science or not. The most current narrative, especially from those of the right, find polls unreliable mostly and bad predictors. So referencing a poll conducted in 2013 and conjunction with a separate poll using different methods and then trying to make those 2 studies and polls work is dubious at best. However ODC and George Mason are both well respected schools. The issue of this article is the click bait – “VOTER FRAUD” title.  There’s no actual case of voter fraud, there’s a case of possible voter registration errors which is a felony but not fraud. (M. Allen 2/25/2017)

On their about page they describe themselves as “TriggerReset (TR) is a web-based magazine that includes information deemed relevant to an average couple, living in the Southern United States”. The website does not disclose ownership or editors.
TriggerReset publishes quotes from factually mixed sources such as the Daily Wire, FaithWire and extreme right wing hate groups such as Jihad Watch: “Germany: Women Offered Pants With “Rape Alarms”…A really good “rape alarm” is the report of a .357 or 9mm round. But it’s Europe, and they’re not allowed to fight back at all…”
In review, TriggerReset typically uses quotes from poor sources and reports news from an extreme right wing perspective, utilizing emotionally loaded words both in their headlines and articles respectively: “Why Are College Kids So Ignorant? Because They’re Indoctrinated by Stupid Leftists…I’m attending college, so I know” and “North Korea Jails, Tortures, and Kills…Christians…In North Korea followers of JESUS are dealt with the same as the democrats think we should be dealt with here…” Story selection has a common theme of being anti-Islam, anti-Left and pro-Christian.

In review, Caldron Pool does not perform original news reporting, but rather takes existing stories from other sources and editorializes them from a Christian Right perspective. Further, they do not distinguish whether content is opinion or straight news reporting. Headlines and articles often contain emotional loaded wording that favors the right such as this: The double-standards of liberals. This story is sourced to tweets. However, other stories on the website are generally sourced properly.
Editorially, Caldron Pool frequently reports negatively on LGBTQ, abortion and most often liberals with loaded emotional quotes such as this: “This only serves division, and shows that the Leftist cult of modern liberalism in Australia needs a narrative of oppression, racism and bigotry, just to appear relevant.” When reporting on LGBTQ they often report fearfully about the acceptance and normalization of LGBTQ by the media and educational institutions (conspiracy). When it comes to science this source does not always support the consensus of science on such topics such as Climate Change and Evolution (pseudoscience). In general, Caldron Pool, publishes news and information that appeals to the far Christian Right.

In review, Breaking911, republishes news from NBC: Trump Bodyguard: Trump Was Offered 5 Russian Women, Turned Offer Down or CNN “Secret Service Agent Working Trump Motorcade Run Down By Vehicle, Driver Arrested” and at the same time they capitalize on clickbait-type headlines such as “NSFW: Leaked video of Cardi B exposing her bare boobs surfaces and crime stories from local media “Husband Kills Wife Less Than 15 Minutes Into New Year, Police Say.” Further, Breaking911 does not appear to have a political bias, but rather publishes sensationalized stories regardless of political affiliation.
In reviewing factual reporting for Breaking911, we found a false claim via Politifact. In this breaking news story they published that an ISIS member tweeted about the Chattanooga mass shooting 15 minutes before it happened. The source of this was the highly questionable Pam Geller, who has a poor track record with fact checkers. Other poor media outlets also reported this, but within a few hours this was refuted as being false. Breaking911 did not delete or amend their story to indicate it was actually false.

Reasoning: Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy
Notes: Stone Cold Truth (SCT) is not a news site so much as a personal blog for Roger Stone. Mr. Stone is a conservative libertarian writer and political pundit, who bills himself as a “Legendary American Political Operative.” The stories on SCT are poorly sourced, marginally factual, and much of the writing borders on conspiracy. Additionally, many of the reference sources at the end of the stories, such as The Daily Caller, are listed as Right Biased or Questionable themselves. As with many extremely biased sites on both the left and the right, many of the facts presented in the stories are either taken out of context or misrepresented.
Example: In the story titled “The Numbers Don’t Lie: Proof Of Fake News Confirmed” the author, Saint John Hunt, conflates a Harvard study showing the percentage of negative press regarding President Trump during his first hundred days with inaccurate reporting. The study does show a high percentage of negative press, and also shows a distinct negative bias from the press towards Trump during that time on some networks, including CNN and CBS. The study does not, however, gauge the accuracy of the reporting on the networks. Negativity does not automatically equate to falsehood, and the use of the numbers from the study as the centerpiece of the story is, at best, misleading.
Due to the overt bias, poor sourcing, and misleading and misrepresented facts, STC is rated Questionable. (D. Kelley 7/10/2017)

History
Founded in 2011, Vani Deva Hari, also known on her blog as the Food Babe, is an American author, activist, and affiliate marketer known for her criticism of the food industry.  Hari’s ideas on food safety have been criticized by scientists as pseudoscience and chemophobia, and others have drawn attention to her apparent financial interest through promotion and marketing of natural foods. According to the about page “you can expect to learn the truth about harmful ingredients in processed foods and how to avoid the stuff the food industry is trying to hide!” 
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The Food Babe website is owned by Vani Deva Hari with revenue derived through affiliate marketing advertising, book sales and the sale of her own food products.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Food Babe publishes recipes which are reasonable and safe, as well as news on her blog that routinely publishes pseudoscience and chemical conspiracy theories. In regards to her recipes, they are generally considered healthy, however the claims made in these recipes may be unrealistic such as this one: Papaya Salad with Miso Turmeric Dressing. While this does sound healthy and tasty the claims made are over the top such as this: “Its star ingredient is the papaya, a tropical fruit that’s very high in vitamin C and loaded with the enzyme papain that helps keep your skin, nails and hair beautiful!” While papaya is certainly a healthy fruit, eating this recipe will not support the claims made. Further, in this recipe the Food Babe takes the opportunity to denigrate GMO’s, without evidence as she does frequently on this website: “When shopping for ingredients for this salad, make sure you choose non-GMO papaya, as this is one of the few fresh fruits that are often GMO.”
The blog portion of her website is where pseudoscience is heavily promoted. For example, there are natural miracle cancer cures such as this: Cancer Fighting Cherry Berry Smoothie as well as very frequent anti-GMO propaganda that is not supported by science, CONFIRMED! Lab tests show over 30+ popular food products contain GMOs. Are you eating them? She has also promoted anti-vaccination propaganda. In general, Vani Deva Hari is a second place finisher to Joseph Mercola, but still dangerous in her claims.

According to their about page “WattsUpWithThat.com is the world’s most viewed website on climate.” Anthony Watts states he was a “television meteorologist who spent 25 years on the air and who also operates a weather technology and content business, as well as continues daily forecasting on radio, just for fun.

According their about page “As a long time “health nut,” author and public speaker, Erin Elizabeth has had a passion for the healing arts for nearly 25 years.

Funded by / Ownership 
Health Nut News is owned by Erin Elizabeth and derives revenue from online advertising and the sale of health related products.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Health Nut News (Erin Elizabeth) is a website that publishes news on alternative health, the environment, recipes and politics. Headlines often feature strong emotional language such as this: Connecticut DCF punishing Tennessee parents for taking their story public? Refuse to let parents visit baby. This story comes directly from Health Impact News, which is a Conspiracy and Pseudoscience website that promotes anti-vaccine propaganda, as well chemtrail conspiracies. Health Nut News frequently utilizes unreliable sources such as Mercola and Natural News, which both have numerous false claims attributed to them.
In general, HHN frequently promotes Anti-Vaccination propaganda and consistently insists on a link between Autism and vaccines, which is not supported by science. HHN also rejects the consensus of science regarding chemtrails and Gmo’s. They also promote conspiracy theories such as the Government suppressing cures for cancer to control population. Lastly, Erin Elizabeth dreamed up a conspiracy theory that holistic Doctors are being killed, supposedly by the pharmaceutical industry. Needless to say this has been thoroughly debunked.

History
Founded in 2011, The Blaze is an American conservative pay television network and website founded by talk radio personality Glenn Beck, based in Irving, Texas. The Blaze has studios and offices based in the Las Colinas urban district in Irving and Los Angeles. On December 3, 2018, The Blaze’s television arm merged with CRTV, the subscription video arm of Conservative Review.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The Blaze is owned by Mercury Radio Arts and is funded through advertising and cable/satellite broadcast fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Blaze reports news with a far right bias that utilizes strong loaded words such as: New Jersey Democrats propose gerrymandering plan that would give them a permanent majority. This story, as an example, is sourced properly to credible mainstream media outlets. Story selection almost always favors the right on The Blaze and there is a heavy Christian bias as well. Again, The Blaze typically sources information appropriately, but is selective in the stories they run and how they are presented to favor the right. 
A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 7% of The Blaze’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 8% Mixed and 85% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that they are strongly preferred by a more conservative audience.
A factual search reveals two failed fact checks directly attributed to The Blaze, here and here. However, the founder of The Blaze, Glenn Beck, has an abysmal track record with 6 Pants on Fire claims from Politifact alone. Since The Blaze is run by Mercury, and not directly by Glenn Beck and his poor record with facts, we will rate The Blaze based on these two failed fact checks.
Overall, we rate The Blaze strongly Right Biased based on story selection that almost always favors the right and Mixed for factual reporting due to a few failed a checks and loaded emotional headlines.  (7/19/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 10/08/2019)

Analysis / Bias
American Thinker consist of two sections, one is articles and the other one is a blog. You can check out their archives Here. 
In review, American Thinker uses strong emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as: “The Most Memorable Leftist Hypocrisies of 2017-8”. This article is authored by Robert Oscar Lopez who writes with extremely biased language: “The left is composed of horrible people.  Most sane people realize this, even if they have friends on the dark side.” Another article with loaded wording is this one: “The Great Depression of 2019?” Although, they utilize credible sources such as thebalance.com, CNBC, New York Times, The Guardian and factually mixed sources such as LifeZette, Wall Street Journal, Human Events.com, they also utilize questionable sources to back their claims, such as Breitbart and non-credible conservative blogs such as michaelsavage.com.  
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, American Thinker has published Anti-LGBT articles, as well as those by prominent white nationalist, Jared Taylor. Further, American Thinker routinely publishes conspiracy theories, such as those by Pamela Geller, who is also on the SPLC’s hate watch list due to anti-Islam positions: Report: Obama said ‘I Am a Muslim’, which has been debunked as a false claim. They have also promoted conspiracies about the Seth Rich Murder and they have published numerous articles that are not supportive of the consensus of science, such as this one: The Hoax of ‘Climate Change’

In review, the New American publishes news that is favorable to the right. There is frequent use of loaded emotional wording such this: Rep. Massie Ridicules John Kerry’s “Pseudo-Science” on Climate.

Reasoning: Extreme Right, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Hate Group
Notes: Understanding the Threat provides threat-focused strategic and operational consultation, training, and education for federal, state, and local leadership and agencies in government, the private sector, and for private citizens. What this really means is Understanding the Threat promotes propaganda about Islam as a whole. The blog articles are written well and do not use loaded words, however it is difficult to ascertain what sources they are using to draw their conclusions.

History
The Federalist is an English-language online magazine that covers politics, policy, culture, and religion. The Federalist has been described as influential in conservative and libertarian circles. The site was co-founded by Ben Domenech and Sean Davis and launched in September 2013. The current editors are David Harsanyi and Mollie Hemingway
On March 26th, 2020 Twitter locked the site’s account for violating its rules against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
According to the website, The Federalist is a wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. The website is funded through online advertising as well as paid subscriptions to newsletters.
Analysis / Bias
The Federalist is a news and opinion website that reports with a right wing bias that typically favors the right and denigrates the left. There is frequent use of loaded emotional language such as this: The New York Times’ Hit Piece On Mike Pence Is Anti-Christian Bigotry, Plain And Simple. In general, The Federalist sources all of their information to credible mainstream outlets, however they sometimes use sources that we have rated mixed for factual reporting such as the Daily Caller.
According to an article from the left leaning Daily Beast, The Federalist was openly critical on Donald Trump before he won the election, but has since become a strong supporter of his Presidency and agenda. Further, In November 2017, The Federalist came under criticism from both conservatives and liberals for publishing an opinion piece by Ouachita Baptist University philosopher Tully Borland defending Roy Moore’s dating of teenagers while he was in his 30s and arguing that such behavior was “not without some merit if one wants to raise a large family.”
When it comes to reporting on scientific issues The Federalist often does not align with the consensus of experts in the field. For example, in this article the author claims that “I am a skeptic when it comes to climate change. To be clear, I don’t doubt that the climate changes — obviously it does. I don’t doubt that human activity has an effect on this change. What that effect is, and to what extent it influences the entire system, I don’t know. As a scientific concept, I have no opinion on climate change.” The author does seem to have an opinion on Climate change when he states “So, simply put, I am a climate change skeptic because the people advocating it do not act as if it were a verified scientific conclusion.” Although the author freely admits he is not an expert and cannot generate an opinion on the scientific concept; he does not need to have an opinion because there is strong scientific consensus on the impact of human influenced climate change. 
The Federalist has also promoted pseudoscience claiming that there is a link between Abortions and Breast Cancer. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists there is  “no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk.”
A factual search reveals that The Federalist has made a few verified false claims.
Obama twice described Americans as “lazy” during a town hall meeting in Laos. – MOSTLY FALSE
“Longstanding whistleblower rules (were changed) just before submittal of the fake whistleblower report.” – FALSE
“As we have learned, the Intel Inspector General (IG) changed the rule after the complaint was known in order to allow hearsay complaints, but the IG dishonestly backdated the rule change so that damage could be done to President Trump.” – PANTS on FIRE (cites false Federalist report that was never corrected)
Overall, we rate The Federalist a borderline Questionable and far Right Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that always favor the right. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to the promotion pseudoscience and three failed fact checks. (8/8/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 03/30/2020)

The Tehran Times has its own news agency called the Mehr News Agency (MNA).

Analysis / Bias
Reporters Without Borders has reported Iran as “One of the most oppressive countries” According to a Reporters Without Borders 2018 report, Iran ranks 164 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. (one point up from last year’s rank)
According to the PBS Iran media guide the Tehran Times is pro-government. The President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani has moved to the left, placing himself with the reformists during the last election, however he is still the leader of the Moderation and Development Party, which is classified as “moderate reformists” “modernist right” or “Republican Right.”
In review, the content of headlines and articles use loaded words pertaining to national news such as “General: U.S. will become aware of Iran’s capabilities when it’s late” and “Iran threatens to exit nuclear deal if talks become a ‘waste of time”.  Further, they poorly source their articles by either heavily quoting or utilizing Questionable Iranian sources such as Tasnim and their own news agency, Mehr. In general, the Tehran Times promotes state propaganda and conspiracy theories.

The Daily Mail is a known a supporter of the Conservatives. They are also one of the pro-Brexit tabloids and according to a Reuters article, the Daily Mail published a controversial headline in response to a Brexit Court ruling criticizing the judges, by branding them as ‘enemies of the people’ According to CNBC, the Daily mail also has been criticized by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales for publishing fake news articles and “hyped up” headlines and “mastered the art of running stories that aren’t true’”.  Further, CNBC reported that DMG media responded by saying “DailyMail.com is the very antithesis of click-bait and hype headlines. We just tell stories better than anyone else.”
In review, the Daily Mail tends to publish stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded wordings such as “Woman, 63, ‘becomes PREGNANT in the mouth’ with baby squid after eating calamari”, which is a misleading headline. In 2017, Wikipedia banned the Daily Mail as an ‘unreliable’ source. When it comes to sourcing information they use minimal hyperlinked sourcing as well as sourcing to themselves. In general, most stories favor the right, however the Daily Mail will report either side if the story is sensational enough.

When not reporting on reptilian humanoids, David Icke promotes anti-vaccine propaganda, aliens, 9/11 conspiracies, and chemtrails. He also supports Brexit and tends to hold a right leaning bias.
Mr. Icke is either the greatest con artist in history having amassed over 20 million dollars on books and speeches or he is certifiably insane.

21st Century Wire is a conspiracy and conjecture site run by Patrick Henningsen. Henningsen has ties to both Infowars and Alex Jones, also known for fake news and broad conspiracies. They also seem to have ties to, or at least to be pro-Russian in much of their content.  Specifically Russian Today (RT) the state run Russian news outlet.

Funded by / Ownership
21st Century Wire is owned by Patrick Henningsen and is funded primarily through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
21st Century Wire is an alternative news website that rejects the consensus of science regarding climate change and also promotes the conspiracy that mainstream media is publishing fake news. This source has also received an unproven claim by Snopes, which 21st Century Wire considers a questionable source. The website Fort Liberty has placed 21st Century Wire on it’s Fake News/Hoax list. 21st Century employs somewhat sensational headlines and does provide sourcing to attempt to support claims, however most are to themselves. The primary issue is that 21st Century publishes some questionable stories (see examples above) that are embedded among legitimate stories they publish. This can mislead the reader.
A factual search reveals 21st Century Wire has a poor record with fact checkers. (D. Van Zandt 7/20/2016)
(Dennis Kelly): 21st Century Wire is a conspiracy and fake news website with an extreme right bias. Additionally, their headlines are sensationalist and largely misleading.
Their stories are non-sourced, with no links except to their own stories, and are little more than loosely associated facts tied together with broad conjecture and innuendo. When trying to research some of their claims myself I could find no corroboration from a credible source. Ironically, they are currently in a self proclaimed war against “Fake News”, and the site features several stories on the subject. These war on “fake news” stories, as with their other content, contain little fact and lots of conjecture, with links to their other stories instead of links to external sources. I have provided a breakdown of one of their stories below.
In the story “The Mainstream Media Contortionists And Their Fake News Circus”. They begin by discussing Agnes Gruta, a journalist writing for La Presse, questioning the bias of Eva Bartlett, a journalist writing for Russia Today. While they admit Ms. Bartlett’s ties to RT, instead of addressing the possible bias of Ms. Bartlett they launch into an attack on Ms. Gruta instead. After this they delve into a broad attack of the purported bias of several other media outlets. There is also an addendum to the story by Ms. Bartlett herself, which is unusual in itself as rebuttals are usually published separately. The rebuttal purports to defend both herself and RT from the question of bias. It falls short however, as Ms. Bartlett, in her own words, admits that her work is biased:
“…no corporate newspaper would publish what I wrote–not without heavy editing and censorship and changing of my chosen lexicon.”
On a personal note, I would have trouble trusting any news source that did not exercise at least some editorial control over what they publish, even an opinion piece. I also have trouble trusting a news source that only cites itself as corroboration of it’s “facts”. (D. Van Zandt 7/20/2016), (D. Kelley 2/15/2017) Updated (11/06/2019)

Several groups that monitor domestic terrorism and hate groups describe the Oath Keepers as extremist or radical. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes the group as “heavily armed extremists with a conspiratorial and anti-government mindset looking for potential showdowns with the government.” The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists the group’s founder as a known extremist and describes his announced plans to create localized militia units as “frightening”. According to the SPLC, the group espouses a number of conspiracy and legal theories associated with the sovereign citizen movement and the white supremacist posse comitatus movement. SPLC senior fellow Mark Potok describes the group as a whole as “really just an anti-government group who believe in a wild set of conspiracy theories.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Woke Sloth is a left biased news and opinion website that frequently uses loaded emotional sensational headlines such as this: Trump Is Whining That He’s Home Alone On Christmas Eve. Woke Sloth does not produce original news content, but rather takes news stories and adds commentary to them that is favorable to the left and denigrating to the right. For example this: “Maybe running for President wasn’t the best idea in the world. As it turns out, you actually have responsibilities and can’t take golf vacations whenever you want. The good news is that the President can resign whenever he wants and go back to running businesses into the ground instead of the entire country.”
When it comes to sourcing, Woke Sloth usually publishes Tweets and then opines about them. Woke Sloth also frequently sources back to themselves from previous articles. In general, all stories on this website favor the left and utilize sensational or misleading headlines.
Overall, we rate Woke Sloth Questionable based on an extreme Left Bias as well as the use of misleading or sensationalized headlines. We also designate them Questionable due to a complete lack of disclosure regarding ownership, purpose and authorship. (D. Van Zandt 12/26/2018.)

History
Founded in 2001, GlobalResearch or Centre for Research on Globalization is a Canadian conspiracy website. It was founded by Michel Chossudovsky who is currently the President of GlobalResearch and professor emeritus of economics at the University of Ottawa. The website does not have an about page, but they do list the people involved with the operation.
Read our profile on Canadian government influence on media.
Funded by / Ownership
Although GlobalResearch does not state ownership, it is assumed Michel Chossudovky is the owner. Revenue is derived through donations and advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, GlobalResearch publishes a combination of real news and conspiracy theories. We will focus on the not so real news. GlobalResearch often reports unfavorably about Israel such as this: The Zionist Idea Has Never Been More Terrifying than It Is Today. This unlabeled opinion piece does not provide a single source of evidence for their claims. When it comes to politics they are strongly anti-capitalism and anti-Globalist as their name suggests. While GlobalResearch does promote legitimate humanitarian concerns, its views on science, economics and geopolitics is very questionable. For example, GR promotes anti-vaccination propaganda, 9-11 as a false flag operation, GMO’s are harmful, and Chemtrails. There are so many more, this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
In general, this is a website the purports to be concerned for humanity, yet routinely publishes false information that misleads humanity.
Failed Fact Checks
“The most likely triggering cause of (microcephaly)” is the “DTaP shot, a vaccine that had been recently mandated by the Brazilian government to be injected into pregnant women.” – False

“There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus” – Inaccurate
“vaccines had cancer enzymes in them” – Inaccurate

Factual Reporting: LOW
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
True Pundit is a political conspiracy website with a far right wing bias. Like most low credibility sources they do not list a mission statement or about page.
Funded by / Ownership
Again, True Pundit does not list ownership or financial information, however, Thomas Paine (real name Michael D. Moore) appears as the name on many articles. This is a pseudonym for a supposed former FBI agent who is now against the FBI and very pro-Trump. It appears this is his website that is funded through advertising and donations via Pay Pal and Patreon.
Analysis / Bias
True Pundit occasionally publishes a legitimate story, however most are right wing conspiracies. The majority of articles from True Pundit have anonymous authors and all of them have a strong right wing bias with generally loaded headlines such as: The FBI Just Kicked the Door in of Anti-Trump San Juan Mayor’s Office in Puerto Rico; Federal Raid. True Pundit continues to beat the Seth Rich Murder conspiracy to death, no pun intended and several other conspiracies which have been debunked. True Pundit also uses Questionable sources such as Your News Wire, which has one of the worst fact checking records in history.
A factual search reveals a poor fact check record.
No, Coretta Scott King didn’t thank Jeff Sessions in video clip – PANTS ON FIRE
To Silence Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton Proposed Drone Strike on Julian Assange? – UNPROVEN
No evidence that former FBI lawyer Lisa Page blamed the Chinese for DNC hack – PANTS ON FIRE
Hillary Clinton Used Hand Signals to Rig Debate? – FALSE

Story selection always favors the right and utilizes strong emotional wording such as this, AL ABORTION BAN – LEFTISTS IN MELTDOWN OVER “PATRIARCHY”. This particular story is poorly sourced to tweets rather than credible media sources. Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children frequently publishes propaganda pieces highlighting the dangers of illegal immigration such as this: TEXAS ILLEGAL ALIEN CHARGED WITH 12 MURDERS OF ELDERLY WOMEN, MAYBE HUNDREDS MORE. This story is sourced to the Associated Press and the factually Mixed Daily Wire. The headline of the story is very misleading as it claims there may be 100’s more murdered by this man, however, the article states that police are investigating 750 other deaths. It does not mean this man was responsible for 100’s of them. This is classic propaganda to seize on a factual statement and make an unknown claim that cannot be substantiated.  In another article they promote the conspiracy that former President Obama is a Muslim as well as the age-old debunked birth certificate conspiracy.  In general, story selection always favors the right, and sometimes poor sources are utilized. They also do not distinguish between straight news and opinion, which is misleading. It is safe to say most content on this website is opinion. Further, they frequently publish outright false or misleading claims and memes on their social media pages. See below.  A factual search reveals numerous failed fact checks on either their website or through social media. Below is a shortlist.      Says U.S. Rep.

Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 2013, One America News Network (OANN), also referred to as One America News (OAN), is an American right-wing pay television news channel and website. According to the Washington Post since the election of Donald Trump OAN has become pro-Trump in coverage and a favorite news source for the President. The founder of OAN is Charles Herring who has said “Fox News has done a great job serving the center-right and independent audiences…But those who consider themselves liberal have a half dozen or more choices on TV each day from which to get their news.” OAN has been criticized for biased content that favors Donald Trump.
On 10/10/2019, President Trump thanked OANN For Providing ‘Fair Coverage And Brilliant Reporting’.
Read our profile on USA government influence on media.
Funded by / Ownership
According to their about page “One America News Network is owned by Herring Networks, Inc. Herring Networks, Inc. is a family-owned and operated, independent media company focused on providing high-quality national television programming to consumers via its national cable networks.” Herring Networks is owned by Robert Herring Sr. who is a Republican donor. One America News is funded through advertising and television subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, OAN is a far-right biased news channel and website that uses moderately loaded words in headlines and articles such as this: Sen. Schumer Refuses To Back Down On Border Wall Funding. This article does not offer sourcing at all. In another article Senate Floats Restrictions On Detentions Of Illegal Aliens In Government Spending Bill, there is again a lack of sourced information.
One America News writes articles that are very short and easy to read. Their aim is to keep stories under 1 minute long. Story selection almost always favors the right and in particular President Donald Trump. An article in AdWeek describes how the owner of Herring Networks directs his newsroom to favor Trump: “According to internal emails, Herring has directed his channel to push Trump’s candidacy, scuttle stories about police shootings, encourage antiabortion stories, minimize coverage of Russian aggression, and steer away from the new president’s troubles, according to more than a dozen current and former producers, writers and anchors, as well as internal emails from Herring and his top news executives.”
OAN has also promoted right-wing conspiracies such as the Seth Rich Murder and that there was no evidence of chemical attacks in Syria.

For example, in this anti-vaccination article, they use fear to persuade people not to vaccinate their children. The article attempts to convince people that more children are vaccine damaged in the USA than children in Syria have been damaged by chemical weapons. This article provides zero evidence to support that more children are injured by vaccines. There is not a single statistic from a reliable source to support this claim. They do, however, claim that the Syrian bombing by the USA was a False flag operation. In fact, the article cites Natural News as the primary source of information. Natural News is a well-known purveyor of pseudoscience, conspiracies, and fake news. Within this same article they cite a source called CDC.news, which is meant to look like an official CDC page, but in fact, is owned by Natural News for the purpose of discrediting the CDC. At least they put a disclaimer on the CDC.news page that it is not affiliated with the credible Centers for Disease Control.  In another article, they claim that Cannabis Oil cured a girl’s Leukemia, even though she had already undergone Chemotherapy. Again, there is zero evidence to prove it was the cannabis oil that cured her. It is simply unproven. Virtually all known conspiracies are covered by this site: Chemtrails, New World Order, False Flag, Aliens, etc. This source also promotes Pseudosciences such as miracle cures with natural products and anti-GMO propaganda. On the bright side, they do appear to support the scientific consensus that climate change is human-influenced. (2/3/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 8/15/2017).

The general philosophy of Popper is that scientist should actively attempt to falsify a hypothesis, rather than prove it. The right-leaning American Council on Science and Health has written why this method may not be the best.   Principia Scientific covers many areas of science, however, most stories center around climate change (global warming) and vaccinations. When it comes to climate change, PSI does not agree CO2 is the primary driver of global warming (Pseudoscience). However, according to its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded: “there’s a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth’s temperatures over the past 50 years.” Further, the National Center for Education states that human-influenced climate change deniers promote a form of pseudoscience: “these deniers attempt to sabotage science education with fringe ideas, pseudoscience, and outright lies.” Finally, according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Science and Pseudoscience “Philosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their views on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in the community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of demarcation. There is a widespread agreement for instance that creationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing, ufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian catastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences.”  PSI takes vaccinations to another level through promoting conspiracies with stories like this: Doctors Who Discovered Cancer Enzymes In Vaccines All Murdered! (Conspiracy). This story is sourced to Neon Nettle, which we rate as a quackery level pseudoscience and tin foil hat conspiracy website. This story is listed as a Pants on Fire claim by Politifact.   In general, the information found on this website falls along the right biased spectrum of science. Although this source claims to champion the traditional scientific method, they nevertheless promote human-influenced climate change denial on the website, which further promotes climate change as a grand conspiracy with scientists “fudging” data.  A factual search reveals numerous failed fact checks by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN):      “Doctors who discovered cancer enzymes in vaccines all found murdered.” – Pants on Fire     Solar Minimum expected to cool the upper-atmosphere – False     We are not heading towards a “mini ice age”, contrary to claims in some media – False     No, an “FDA study” did not find that vaccines contain cancer-causing viruses – Inaccurate     Volcanic CO2 emissions are known to be much smaller than human-caused emissions – Inaccurate     “Father of Global Warming’ Scientist Finally Admits Theory Is Wrong” – Inaccurate","Overall, we rate Principia Scientific International (PSI) a strong conspiracy and Pseudoscience website that promotes anti-vaccine propaganda and frequent misinformation regarding climate change.

WayneDupree.com does not publish original news stories, but rather uses quotes from other sources and offers conservative opinions regarding the story. Most headlines and articles contain loaded emotional wording such as this: Opinion: Dems Don’t Care About Trial; They’re Trying To Rig 2020 Election With Impeachment Stigma. WayneDupree.com typically sources their information to a variety of credible sources as well as questionable ones with poor fact check records such as: Bizpac Review, Big League Politics, Breaking911 and the Daily Mail.
Editorially, WayneDupree.com is strongly conservative and pro-Trump. Most opinion pieces denigrate liberals such as this: Opinion: A Democrat Meltdown Is Happening! The Dems Just Handed The Election To The Republicans! The website also promotes conspiracy theories such as this: Still Investigating: Actors in Sandy Hook hoax are identified (Photos) as well as the Pizzagate conspiracy and the Clinton’s murdering their opponents or anyone who may expose them of some wrongdoing. In general, WayneDupree.com publishes opinions that align with the extreme right and sometimes are not factual.
A factual search reveals a few confirmed failed fact checks.
Overall, we rate WayneDupree.com Questionable based on extreme right wing bias, use of poor sources, promotion of propaganda and conspiracy theories as well as three failed fact checks. (D. Van Zandt 1/21/2020)

Founded in 2009, Before It’s News is a citizens journalism website where stories are provided by individuals without credentials.  Stories can range from moderately credible to tin-foil hat conspiracies. According to their about page “As we were following the 2008 election, we noticed something very interesting — bloggers covered many of the breaking stories days before the alphabet soup news outlets (NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, AP, MSNBC, FOX, etc.). Important facts were omitted or ignored by the mainstream media mainly because these facts inconveniently do not fit into the memes these outlets routinely promote. In other words, there is a strong bias amongst most corporate media outlets.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, anyone can publish news on this website which has resulted in it becoming a haven for conspiracy theorists and pseudo-scientists. Although Before It’s News proclaims to vet articles for factual accuracy, it seems they actually choose to publish the opposite. For example, they promote anti-vaccination propaganda, chemtrails, false flags, anti-climate change info and the right wing Clinton Body count conspiracies. In general, Before It’s News is one of the most discredited sources on the internet that promotes pseudoscience and right wing conspiracy theories. 
A factual search reveals they have failed numerous fact checks. For example this: No, George Soros was not arrested in Switzerland in February 2019. They are also on Politifact’s fake news list.
Overall, we rate Before It’s News Questionable based on the promotion of pseudoscience and right wing conspiracy theories as well as poor sourcing, a lack of transparency and publication of fake news. (7/20/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 10/27/2019)

Based in Cyprus, the editor of the website is Alexander Mercouris, who in 2012 was disbarred as an attorney in London. According to the Telegraph, he then went on to become a “pro-Russian commentator on world affairs for Russian TV news outlets and websites.”
The Duran’s director is Peter Lavelle, who is host of RT’s (Russian state news outlet) political debate program CrossTalk.
In 2018, the right leaning Weekly Standard accused The Duran of peddling Russian “Fake News.”
The website does not provide an about page, mission statement, funding or obvious ownership information.

The Duran is owned by the Cyprus based DRN Media PLC. Moscow native Alex Christoforou is the President and Chairman of DRN Media PLC. Funding for The Duran comes from Paypal and Patreon donations, as well as advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Duran publishes news and opinions with a conservative and pro-Russian perspective, such as this: Roger Stone Shines New Light on Russia-Gate Hoax. This story is copied and pasted directly from the pro-Russian Strategic Culture Foundation. In general, all articles involving Russia are positively slanted such as these: Russia Grinds Out Wins In Europe and Trump boxed in on Iran, as Putin holds key to prevent war in Persian Gulf (Video). Many articles are poorly sourced to Russian Propaganda outlets such as RT and Sputnik.
When covering the USA, the Duran demonstrates a conservative bias with frequent articles denigrating the left such as this: Rudy Giuliani DESTROYS Hillary Clinton, “America’s Number One Crime Family” (Video) and this story promoting a conspiracy theory, NXIVM Sex-Cult Prosecutors Have Evidence Of Illegal Clinton Campaign Contributions For “Political Influence”. This latter story is copied and pasted from the right wing conspiracy website Zerohedge. 
In general, The Duran routinely publishes pro-Russian propaganda and promotes right wing conspiracies through the use of poorly sourced, plagiarized news articles.

History
Founded in 2012 by Nick Meyer, AltHealthWorks is a website that reports news on alternative health, holistic practices and nutrition.

Analysis / Bias
In review, AltHealthWorks publishes news related to alternative health. Articles are broken down into categories such as GMO, Monsanto, Natural Treatments and Alternative Medicine. When reporting on GMO’s they are often negative and deviate from the consensus of science such as this Farmer Conducts Experiment Using GMO and Non-GMO Corn, Discovers Sobering Truth That Animals Know and Humans Don’t. In another article titled 10 Documented Reasons GMOs are Anti-American they promotes the debunked 2012 study by Gilles-Éric Séralini, which was retracted from the Food and Chemical Toxicology Journal the “following year after a detailed review following criticism from scientists and regulatory bodies, which found a pattern of bias and design flaws. The study used cancer-prone rats, shoddy controls and the data cherry-picked (e.g. data showed some rats fed glyphosate had few tumors, which the authors did not highlight in their commentary).” 
AltHealthWorks also promotes miracle cures such as eating a Non-GMO diet that cures just about everything including autism: Mothers Break the Silence: How Feeding Their Kids a Non-GMO Diet Healed Everything From Autism Symptoms to Autoimmune Disease. Speaking of autism they also go against the consensus of the science in claiming that vaccines cause autism as well as promoting that autism can be cured, which is not true: “There is No Better Feeling:” Child’s Autistic Symptoms Miraculously Disappear After Doctor Makes One Simple-Yet-Profound Change.

Notes: Blunt Force Truth is a podcast hosted by long time game show host Chuck Woolery. We are reviewing the content of his website for this review. Chuck Woolery is a conservative who has multiple controversies surrounding him such as claims of anti-semitism.
In review, the website essentially republishes news from other right wing sources. Some of these sources are on our questionable list such as Gateway Pundit and American Lookout. All articles on Blunt Force Truth favor the right and are anti-left. There is strong use of loaded language and as pointed out, poor use of credible sources.

Analysis / Bias
In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Norway number 1 in their 2019 Press Freedom Index and states “Today, the media are free and journalists are not subject to censorship or political pressure.” 
Forbes reported in June 2019, due to Google’s Algorithm Core Update, CCN Markets suffered a 71% drop in traffic and considered shutting down, however they later cancelled that decision. 
Currently, Conservative Party leader Erna Solberg is the Prime Minister of Norway. 
In review, when reporting on Norway, CCN Markets publishes articles critical of the Norwegian Government’s bitcoin policy, such as “Norway: Tax on Crypto Mining Scares away $116 Million Foreign Investment”. The article reads “A parliamentary representative even called bitcoin “the dirtiest form of cryptographic output, making it clear that they were not happy with the ways things were going in Norway’s local crypto mining sector.”  
When covering world news pertaining to America, they publish stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “Finance Professor Says Stock Market Is Cheap. Here’s Why He’s Wrong” and  “Mnuchin Warns US Debt Ceiling Near, Wants Spending Spigot Open”. CCN often utilizes credible sources such as The Hill , CNBC, The Intercept, Forbes, Japan Times, Financial Times, and Bloomberg News.  CCN Markets also uses sources such as fred.stlouisfed.org (Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)), hacked.com (founded by Jonas Borchgrevink) and local sources while reporting news related to Norway, such as e24.no.
Further, CCN publishes articles critical of President Trump, such as these: “The Best Crypto Industry Reaction to Trump’s Bitcoin-Bashing Tweet” and “Trump’s Fed Pick Isn’t Just a Gold Bug – She’s Also a Crypto Bull.” A quote regarding Trump from the latter article reads “The three-tweet thread railed against crypto and sung the praises of central bank money. It read like it had been drafted by New York Times columnist and Keynesian economist Paul Krugman.”
Lastly, CCN publishes Op-Eds that favors a decentralized monetary system (Libertarian) and reports negatively on Socialism and US progressive politicians.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

Notes: Defiant America is an extreme right news and opinion blog. Most headlines utilize loaded words to sensationalize the stories they are republishing. For example, this headline uses the word “delusional” to describe liberals: “Kellyanne Uses Props to Help Liberals With Their Delusional Trump-Russia Collusion Story (Video)”. This type of wording already sways the reader to view liberals negatively. Defiant America makes an effort to source their information, however many times they link back to far right or other questionable sources such as the American Mirror.

Funded by / Ownership
Occupy Democrats is owned by Omar and Rafael Rivero. Omar Rivero also owns the liberal website Washington Press, which we have rated left biased and mixed for factual reporting. Occupy Democrats is funded though advertising and sponsored content. 
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Occupy Democrats website has not been updated with news content since July 2018, therefore will evaluate their older content as well as their Facebook postings. Articles on the website use strongly loaded words that favor the left such as: Trump Just Made Bizarre Collusion Accusations In This Morning’s Twitter Rant. This article is properly sourced to Politico as well as President Trump’s tweets. Other articles reviewed were also properly sourced to outlets such as the Charlotte Observer and NBC News, however they also sourced to factually Mixed outlets such as Raw Story. In general story selection always favors the left. 
A review of the Occupy Democrats Facebook page shows many left wing memes being posted as well as news articles that always favor the left and denigrate the right. 
A factual search reveals a very poor track record with IFCN Fact Checkers. Below is a list of just a few of their many failed fact checks.
Overall, we rate Occupy Democrats Questionable due to extreme left wing bias, promotion of propaganda and conspiracies as well the publication of fake news as evidence by numerous failed fact checks. (5/15/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 2/07/2019)

Virtually every article/video is positive toward right leaning positions and negative towards the left.

In another, they promote the conspiracy that George Soros is behind funding everything anti-right: George SOROS: The One-Man Illuminati Machine. Other than promoting conspiracies they also advocate for the Men’s Rights Movement (anti-feminism). They also have categories that rail against Islam and Black Lives Matter.

The website does not openly disclose ownership, however it is assumed Joe Newby is the primary owner. Revenue is derived through advertising. There is also a link to an online store that leads to Keep and Bear, however this does not appear to be working at the time of this review.
Analysis / Bias
We will break this source down using our criteria. First, we look at wording and headlines. With these, Conservative Firing Line heavily uses emotional loaded words that are pro-right and anti-left. An example of a highly biased headline is as follows: Kid Rock triggers liberal snowflakes with true statement about life and hard work… The use of the words “triggers liberal snowflakes” is about as extreme as you can get using loaded words to emotionally sway readers. Next, we look at sourcing and factual reporting. In this area Conservative Firing Line makes an effort to source their information. However, there are many cases when they source to far right media sources or other questionable sources such as Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which has a poor track record with fact checkers.
We also found evidence of CFL publishing unproven conspiracies such as the Clinton’s murdering multiple people. Within this article about the Clinton’s they source numerous questionable and conspiracy websites.
For factual reporting, Conservative Firing Line is mixed due to misleading headlines and the use of poor sources. Our next criteria is balanced reporting. Does Conservative Firing Cover both sides of issues in their articles? The answer to that is a 100% no. They never do. This source is 100% biased in favor of conservatives and against liberals. Lastly, we look at the website’s political affiliation and how they describe themselves. According to their about page “The Conservative Firing Line was established in May 2012 in an effort to inform, educate and inspire grassroots conservatives at all levels.” Therefore, we rate them right biased for political affiliation.

Notes: Truth in Media is a website owned and operated by Benjamin Swann who is an American television news anchor and journalist. He has worked in New Mexico, Texas, Ohio, Washington, D.C., and Georgia. While at Fox affiliate WXIX-TV in Cincinnati, Ohio, he began producing a fact-checking series entitled “Reality Check”, which has garnered media attention for presenting conspiracy theories. According their about page: “Truth In Media’s content echoes the honest, unabashed and groundbreaking reporting that millions of people have appreciated from Ben for many years. Our mission is to continue our role in upholding integrity and impartiality in the Fourth Estate with an exceptional lineup that shares an ambition to preserve candor in the media.”
In review, Truth in Media attempts to investigate stories that the mainstream media won’t cover. One of the reasons why the mainstream media won’t cover these topics is because they are not true or have been debunked. For example, Ben Swann has promoted the Pizzagate conspiracy theory as well as those related to the Sandy Hook Elementary Massacre. Swann has expressed skepticism of the scientific consensus that vaccines do not cause autism. Further, almost all of Truth in Media’s stories favor the right and discredit the left. Truth in Media/Ben Swann also has a poor track record with fact checkers. Overall, we rate Truth in Media a Questionable source based on overt right wing bias, promotion of conspiracies and a poor track record with fact checkers. (7/19/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 2/9/2018)

History
Founded in 2014, Science Vibe is a junk science website that often promotes pseudoscience and misleading news stories. According to their about page, they state “ScienceVibe educates, entertains, engages and enlightens. From scientific breakthroughs to the bizarre, fascinating and seemingly impossible!”
Science Vibe does not disclose who owns the website or edits the the stories. In other words, they completely lack transparency.
Funded by / Ownership
The website does not disclose ownership and revenue is derived from advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Science Vibe publishes a combination of credible science news stories such as this New Zealand Bans People From Swimming With Dolphins to the absurd such as this Is Earth a “Alien” Prison Planet?
The website frequently covers UFO sightings as well promotes highly misleading stories. For example, in this story, Fatal Rooster Attack Kills 76 Year Old Woman, which is true, they use an obviously Photoshopped image of a YOUNG women laying in a pool of blood. This is very poor quality Photoshopping at that. See below.

Notes: The Remnant is a Traditionalist Catholic newspaper published twice a month in the United States. Although its editors are not affiliated with any particular institute or traditionalist group, the paper is sympathetic to Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and the Society of St. Pius X. Founded in 1968, it is the oldest Traditionalist Catholic newspaper in the United States.
The Remnant is considered an active “Radical Traditionalist Catholic” hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to the SPLC the Remnant is intolerant toward Jews through Holocaust denial and the claim that when the Anti-Christ arrives he will be a Jew. The Remnant also holds anti-LGBTQ views. Further, they endorse the New World Order conspiracy theory, however they believe the New World Order is run by Zionists.  The editors of The Remnant reject the claim that they are a hate group.
In review, The Remnant has an extreme right wing bias in story selection that always favors the right. They strongly endorse Donald Trump and his policies. The Remnant uses loaded words in headlines/articles and typically doesn’t use hyperlink sourcing. Further, The Remnant does not support the consensus of science regarding climate change and even goes so far as to call it a hoax. Overall, we rate The Remnant Questionable based on extreme right bias, promotion of propaganda and conspiracy theories and others labeling them a hate group. (D. Van Zandt 12/09/2017)

The Unz Review has a long list of columnist and bloggers, although we couldn’t go through all of the list, some known names are Pat Buchanan, Steve Sailer, Ilana Mercer, and Ron Paul. Steve Sailer has been criticized as both a racist and Islamophobe. He is also listed as a promoter of hate by utilizing primitive stereotypes to describe people of color. Ilana Mercer is also listed as a promoter of hate toward Muslims, according the Southern Poverty Law Center. Further, Ron Unz has donated money to known hate groups and anti-Semite organizations.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Unz Review publishes articles with loaded words such as “Trump’s Strategy Working—He’s Maneuvered Democrats, RINOS, Into Favoring Foreigners Over Americans.“ On this particular article they utilize questionable sources such as vdare.com, which is classified as an extremist White Nationalist group. They also use a different approach in which they utilize minimally loaded emotional language in their headlines such as “’Shithole Countries’: What Makes a Country? the Place or the People?” However, in the body of the article one can find plenty of racism and hate under the disguise of a philosophical discussion. Further, they also utilize factually mixed sources such as Mises Institute  and occasionally credible sources such as Consortium News and Politico, however they use them only to illustrate their far right views via questionable sources.
Overall, we rate The Unz Review a Questionable Source due extreme right wing bias, promotion of propaganda and hate, as well as utilizing poor sources. (M. Huitsing 2/12/2018) Updated (8/26/2018)

Reasoning: Extreme Right, Propaganda
Notes: Truth Uncensored is a news and opinion website with an extreme right wing bias in reporting. Every article either favors the right or is negative toward the left. There is extensive use of loaded emotional words, especially when describing news that involves liberals. Truth Uncensored also promotes propaganda, such as when they claim: President Trump Cuts More US Debt for a Longer Period of Time THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. While it may be true that the debt has been cut since Trump took office, the actual budget and spending is from President Obama’s fiscal year 2017 budget, which runs until September 30, 2017. Any changes in debt will not be associated with Donald Trump. This is a classic example of propaganda, where a fact is used to mislead people. In this same article they also use questionable sources such as The Gateway Pundit and BB4SP. Truth Uncensored also has a misleading claim via Snopes. Overall, we rate Truth Uncensored as a Questionable Source based on promotion of extreme right wing propaganda and the use of poor sources who have failed many fact checks. (D. Van Zandt 8/21/2017)

History
Founded in 2012, Illuminati Watcher (IW) is an online magazine published by Isaac Weishaupt. As the title suggests, it seeks to uncover and expose the Illuminati conspiracy that, according to Mr. Weishaupt, permeates society, with an emphasis on its influence in the music and entertainment industries. According to their about page Isaac Weishaupt has been “researching my entire life as an ongoing mission to determine if this reality is the truth or a cunning holographic deception. I don’t fully subscribe to any conspiracy theories, but I do find some intriguing if they resonate with any logic (also if they don’t, who am I kidding, some of them are just clever).”
Funded by / Ownership
Illuminati Watcher is owned by Isaac Weishaupt and is funded through a Patreon Account.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the articles and YouTube videos are long on theory and conjecture, with little or no hard facts to substantiate the claims. In fairness, even Mr. Weishaupt himself states that the information provided is just theories.
“Let it be clear that these are all theories. I am merely looking at factual events and occult history and attempting to make links in the name of entertainment.”
The stories and videos, however, are heavily worded and weighted in favor of belief. Due to the bias in the reporting, and a lack of hard factual evidence to support the claims, Illuminati Watcher is rated as a Conspiracy-Pseudoscience source. (D. Kelley 3/12/2017)
Further, Illuminati Watchers covers such topics as Aliens and Transhumanism as well as stories about Chemtrails that links back to Infowars.

Analysis / Bias
In review, RealFarmacy is a health news website that promotes both conspiracies and mostly pseudoscience. For example, many articles on this website promote anti-Vaccination propaganda such as this: Proof That It Is Actually Vaccinated People Who Are Spreading Communicable Disease. This article cites the credible Kaiser Health News and then turns to right wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for analysis. RealFarmacy also publishes miracle cancer cures and prevention such as this: Manuka Honey: Improves Sleep, Boosts Immunity, Prevents Cancer, and Is a Natural Antibiotic. In case you were wondering, there isn’t evidence that Manuka Honey prevents cancer. Some other Pseudoscience topics you will find on RealFarmacy is humans being poisoned by chem trails, Fluoride alarmism and most commonly how deadly GMO’s are to humans. In general, this site disrespects science to such a degree it is less than non-credible.
A factual search reveals too many failed checks to list.
Overall, we rate RealFarmacy a Quackery level Pseudoscience website for the promotion of anti-vaccination propaganda, as well as dangerous miracle cures for cancer and a complete rejection of science on all levels. (7/21/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 1/19/2019)

In review, Health Impact News publishes health related news stories that they state are alternative. Our analysis concurs that they are certainly alternative to conventional science and medicine. They are fiercely anti-vaccine with articles such as this: Dangerous Vaccines Found to Cause Symptoms of Shaken Baby Syndrome. This story comes from the discredited VacTruth website. They also routinely publish anti-GMO propaganda such as this. They are also purveyors of misinformation regarding Chemtrails and Geoengineering such as this: Covert Chemical Geoengineering Programs – A Real Threat to Public Health.

History
Founded in 2011, Ancient Origins is a website that reports on ancient history of earth and the human species. According to their mission “The goal of Ancient Origins is to highlight recent archaeological discoveries, peer-reviewed academic research and evidence, as well as offering alternative viewpoints and explanations of science, archaeology, mythology, religion and history around the globe. We’re the only Pop Archaeology site combining scientific research with out-of-the-box perspectives.”
Ancient Origins publishes a quarterly magazine as well.
The website does not list an editor and articles display the author, however biographical information is not provided. In general there is a lack of transparency.
Funded by / Ownership
Ancient Origins does not openly disclose ownership on the website, however it appears to by copyrighted to Stella Novus. According to their about page “Stella Novus was established in Ireland in 2016, to create, deliver and promote quality content. The company’s first project was Ancient Origins, a news and educational website specializing in archaeology, ancient history, human origins and mythologies from all over the world.” Revenue is generated through advertising, membership fees and magazine subscriptions.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Ancient Origins publishes news and information regarding ancient history and human origins. Although many articles on this website are factual and pro-science there are some that fall under the pseudoarchaeology and pseudohistory tag. It should be noted that the website disclaims they publish alternative viewpoints. This story, for example is properly sourced and true Lost temple of the Pharaoh Ptolemy IV found in Egypt. While this story promotes ancient aliens speculation: Did Ancient Aliens Impart Advanced Astronomical Knowledge to the Dogon Tribe?. In this story they report on current alien visitations Ex US Military Veteran claims to have worked with aliens. This story originates from the website openminds.tv. In general, Ancient Origins does what it states in its mission. It publishes credible verifiable information alongside unproven alternative pseudoscience.
Overall, we rate Ancient Origins a moderate conspiracy and pseudoscience source based on promotion of ancient aliens. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting as they also publish credible pro-science information. (D. Van Zandt 5/12/2017) Updated (10/4/2019)

History
Founded in 2013, Truth and Action is a news and opinion website with an extreme right wing bias in reporting. The primary focus of the website is Prepping, Survival and Gun Rights. The website does not have an about page, nor does it disclose ownership, however they do provide a description on their Facebook page: “I’m tired of saying nothing & doing nothing. It’s time we rally together, get the truth out & make changes to the system.”

Although Truth and Action does not disclose ownership a domain search indicates the website is registered to Truth and Action LLC. Revenue is derived from advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Truth and Action typically takes news stories from other sources and then summarizes them or adds additional commentary from a conservative perspective. Headlines use moderately loaded language such as this Ocasio-Cortez: The Electoral College is a ‘Scam’ That Hurts Minorities. This story is sourced back to Fox News. Truth and Action also frequently publishes right wing conspiracy theories such as this: New Video Exposes Potential Fraud Committed by Rep. Ilhan Omar. The source for this story is Alpha News, which we have rated as “Questionable based on extreme right bias, poor sourcing of information, promotion of conspiracy theories and anti-Islamic propaganda, as well as a lack of transparency regarding ownership.” A fact check reveals the fraud claims against Ilhan Omar have not been proven. Truth and Action also reports on False Flags and promotes anti-vaccination propaganda. This latter story on vaccines is sourced to the highly discredited Natural News, which frequently advances right wing conspiracy theories and dangerous pseudoscience. The website also promotes debunked conspiracy theories regarding Fluoride, such as this: Drink filtered water: Harvard Study Shows Flouride lowers IQ in children and promotes neurotoxicity in adults. The claim that Flouride lowers IQ has been debunked by subsequent studies. 
Editorially, Truth and Action 100% favors the right and President Donald Trump.
A factual search reveals a few failed fact checks.
Overall, we rate Truth and Action a Questionable source based on extreme right wing bias, promotion of conspiracies and pseudoscience as well poor use of sources, failed fact checks and a lack of transparency. (8/10/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 8/25/2019)

History
Founded in 2016, YourContent or YC.news is a news and opinion website based in Pennsylvania. According to their about page they claim “We supply the world’s mainstream media outlets with adrenaline-filled, breaking news footage on a daily basis. A small example of our clientele includes Fox News, CBS, NBC, ABC, USA Today, TMZ, Philly.com, CNN, TIME and a number of others.” There is zero evidence to support this claim.
The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership. However, at the bottom of the page it claims the information is copyrighted to Original Media Group Corporation. We were not able to find this company registered in any state. A search indicates that one of their authors named Nikolaos Hatziefstathiou is the President of this company, which we assume means he is the owner.
In 2019, Nikolaos Hatziefstathiou was charged with tampering with public records, forgery, identity theft, and related offenses. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer “Investigators say Hatziefstathiou, creator and self-appointed “president of news” of the website YC News, doctored an email from his former parole officer to peddle a bogus conspiracy that a member of the Delaware County Adult Probation and Parole Department had accidentally CC’d him on an epithet-filled email. ‘He will use any means to create a false narrative,’ District Attorney Katayoun M. Copeland said of Hatziefstathiou at a news conference announcing his arrest. ‘He will go to any length to do so.’”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Swarajya covers various topics including social, political, economic and cultural life of India. As well as world news, infrastructure, sports, defense, politics, podcasts, culture and more. They publish stories with loaded headlines such as “For A Second Term Please Do The Right Things, Mr Prime Minister!”  Typically they utilize sources such as The Hindu and credible sources such as Reuters, but most of the time they source through the use quotes and rarely provide links. For USA news coverage, their news is mostly balanced with neutral headlines and utilize sources such as Reuters.  However, they have been accused of peddling misinformation by other sources such as Alt News. In general, news and opinion is presented with a right bias and many times is not factual.
Failed Fact Checks
Overall, we rate Swarajya Questionable due to poor sourcing (lack of) and the publication of right wing propaganda. We also rate them Low for factual reporting due to numerous failed fact checks. (M. Huitsing 2/27/2018) Updated (3/31/2020)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Explain Life does not produce original content, but rather heavily quotes other news stories and interjects right biased opinions. Most articles contain loaded emotional language such as this: It’s Happening: Barack Obama’s Worst Nightmare Was Just Revealed. Most of the time the news stories they are republishing are derived from far right sources that we have deemed questionable such as the Gateway Pundit, which has failed numerous fact checks. Story selection always favors the right and in particular President Trump and frequently denigrates the left.
When not reporting extreme right biased opinions, Explain Life publishes conspiracy theories and pseudoscience such as this: U.S. Water Fluoridation: A Forced Experiment that Needs to End. The risk of fluoride has been debunked numerous times. They also promote ridiculous conspiracies such as the Clinton Body Count, Isn’t it obvious? Jeffrey Epstein Was Murdered Because Dead Men Don’t Talk. This story is sourced to the discredited Mike Adams from Natural News, a well known purveyor of fake news, conspiracies and dangerous pseudoscience. Finally, they report on conspiracies regarding Joe Biden’s health and the Deep State. In general, this is not a credible source for information.

Natural News has been blocked by Google and several others over the course of its history.

Natural News is owned by Mike Adams, who owns numerous other fake and or controversial websites. The website, like all of Mike Adams properties are funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Mike Adams is known as the Health Ranger according to Rationalwiki. However, they point out dozens of cases where his claims are false. Besides promoting pseudoscience, Natural News is an extreme right wing biased source that frequently promotes Donald Trump propaganda such as these: President Trump has a constitutional MANDATE to use the military to protect our southern border – Richard Sacks. This article is sourced to Natural News and Brighteon News, which we have never heard of. In this conspiracy story, there is zero evidence and hence why it is a conspiracy: CONFIRMED: Barack Obama was running the entire spygate operation that violated federal law to spy on Trump.campaign officials. In general, politically, all stories favor the right and promote pseudoscience such as chemtrails, the Sandy Hook shooting being a false flag: Sandy Hook: mind-control flicker effect. Lastly, this source denies the consensus on climate change without evidence as seen here: Climate change cultists are now taking over your local weather forecast. 
A factual search reveals that Natural News has failed too many fact checks to list here. 
Overall, we rate Natural News a Questionable source based on promotion of quackery level pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, as well as extreme right wing bias. This is one of the most discredited sources on the internet. (7/21/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 3/02/2019)

Notes: Teddy Stick is a news and opinion website with an extreme right wing bias. Teddy Stick publishes unverified or false news such as the story of Trump Tower being wiretapped. As of this writing there is zero evidence that this claim is true. Interestingly, the primary writer for Teddy Stick claims to be a Libertarian Journalist, however he makes a non-libertarian false report about increased crime in Sweden due to Muslim immigration. This too has been refuted by multiple sources including the libertarian Reason.com. I see nothing here related to the libertarian platform.

History
Founded in 2019, PC Must Die News is an ultra-conservative pro-Trump news and opinion source. According to their about page they state “We are not a satire or fake news site”, as well as “We are comprised of Conservatives, Libertarians, and Constitutionalists who support America and our Constitution. We support the 2nd amendment, freedom of speech, and other American values.” This website completely lacks transparency as they do not provide bios for authors or disclose ownership information.
Funded by / Ownership
PC Must Die News does not disclose ownership nor names of editors or those profiting from the website. Obvious revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, PC Must Die News does not publish original news content, but rather takes an existing story and quotes it, while offering right leaning opinions. For example, in this story California says independents can vote for Democrats’ 2020 primary, but not Republicans’, which is taken almost word for word from the Los Angeles Times. Basically, the website rewords news stories from other sources. Some of these sources are not pro-science such as this: New Finnish Study Finds No Evidence For Man-Made Climate Change. Another category on the website is called “Instant Karma'”, which generally highlights minorities committing crimes while using racial slurs such as this: Thug Trying To Mug Woman Gets Beaten Senseless, Begs Her to Call the Cops. This website also supports Trump: Pair of Anit-Trumpers try to Fight Trump Supporter and get Whooped on Video and denigrates liberals Trevor Noah asks Hillary Clinton how she killed Jeffrey Epstein.
In general, this is a source that is questionable due to fake news, extreme bias and poor sourcing.
Overall, we rate PC Must Die News a Questionable Source based on Extreme Right Bias, Poor Sourcing, Propaganda, Conspiracy, Fake news and Lack of Transparency. (D. Van Zandt 11/22/2019)

In review, one of their featured writers is Joseph Mercola, who is also on our pseudoscience list for promotion of unproven homeopathic remedies and anti-vaccination conspiracy. They also publish articles about the existence of human souls and ghosts, which have not been proven to exist. There are some valid articles on this website, however there are also many as described above. Navigate this site with caution and fact check claims against scientific websites.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: MIXED
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 2015 by Christian Televangelist James Robison and not to be confused with Al Jazeera’s program called the Stream. The Stream is an online news and opinion website that is overtly Christian. According to their about page “The Stream is a national daily championing freedom, smaller government and human dignity. Offering both original content and the best from across the web, The Stream challenges the worst in the mainstream media while offering a rich and lively source for breaking news, inspiration, analysis and entertainment.”
Funded by / Ownership
The website is owned by Life Outreach International Association of Churches, Inc., which routinely has an annual income over $50 million per year. These primarily come from individual donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Stream reports news from a Christian Right perspective such as this: Old Friend of Trump Makes the Case: He’s Not Racist!, which is written by Mike Huckabee, who has an extremely poor track record with facts. Virtually all stories favor the right, and advocate for Christianity with zero regard for science. For example, with climate change all articles at the least deny the consensus on impact and at most outright deny human influence. They also are opposed to evolution and frequently report negatively on homosexuality. They also make claims such as tying eugenics to minimum wage. Besides promoting pseudoscience such as human influenced climate change denial and creationism, they also promote conspiracy theories such as the debunked Seth Rich-Wikileaks conspiracy.
Overall, we rate The Stream a moderate Conspiracy website based on promotion of right wing conspiracies and a strong Pseudoscience site for promotion of climate change denial and creationism, as well as non-scientific information regarding homosexuality. (D. Van Zandt 12/9/2016) Updated (8/9/2019)

Besides promoting pseudoscience, Big Government News is an extreme right wing biased source that frequently promotes Donald Trump propaganda such as these: Secret trials, secret witnesses, secret proceedings… “impeachment” nothing but a deep state kangaroo court like you’d see in a Third World country This article is sourced to the highly questionable Gateway Pundit which has failed numerous fact checks. In this conspiracy story, there is zero evidence and hence why it is a conspiracy: Death camps, mass starvation and forced obedience to govt may follow open borders, free health care for illegals & the total destruction of the US Constitution if Democrats win in 2020.
In general, politically, all Mike Adam’s stories favor the right and promote pseudoscience such as chemtrails, the Sandy Hook shooting being a false flag: Sandy Hook was theater! Actor who played law enforcement sniper was recorded walking around carrying rifle by the magazine. Further, they routinely publish anti-vaccination propaganda and conspiracy theories. Lastly, this source denies the consensus on climate change without evidence, as seen here: Climate change cultists are now taking over your local weather forecast.
A factual search reveals that websites associated with the Natural News Network has failed too many fact checks to list here.
Overall, we rate Big Government News an extreme right biased tin foil hat conspiracy website that also promotes pseudoscience. This is one of the most discredited sources on the internet. (10/31/16) Updated (D. Van Zandt 10/16/2019)

The Activist Mommy has also been criticized for giving advice on how to get away with beating your children. Lastly, she has falsely claimed that LGBTQ ‘sneak into schools to rape the minds of our children’.

History
Founded in 1999 by Alex Jones, InfoWars is a far right American conspiracy theorist and fake news website and media platform. The radio program originates from Austin, Texas and is broadcast on over 100 radio stations. InfoWars routinely reports fake news that has led to harassment lawsuits against Alex Jones. InfoWars is most famous for promoting the fake false flag idea that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings were staged by actors and directed by the government. This has resulted in numerous lawsuits against Jones by grieving parents who lost their children in the mass shooting. Further, during a child custody case, Jones’ attorney admitted that Alex Jones is a “performance artist.”
In February 2018, Alex Jones was accused by former employees of antisemitism and sexual harassment of women staff members. Jones denied the allegations. In August of 2018, InfoWars/Alex Jones content was removed and banned from Facebook, Youtube, Spotify and Apple due to a violation of community standards through the promotion of hate speech.

Analysis / Bias
In review, InfoWars is a Tin Foil Hat Conspiracy multimedia source. Alex Jones has become famous by selling fake stories and debunked claims to a large audience. There are simply too many crazy conspiracies to list and with that in mind, here are some of his more famous/infamous claims:
The New World Order is run by Pedophiles (Pizzagate)
911 was an inside job
San Bernardino False Flag
Man-made Hurricanes and Tornadoes 
Mind Control Operations
Editorially, Infowars presents with an extreme right wing bias with virtually all stories favoring the right and denigrating the left such as this: ADD ONE TO CLINTON BODY COUNT, JEFFREY EPSTEIN KILLED DURING SUICIDE WATCH. There obviously isn’t any evidence to support Infowars claim and hence why it is a conspiracy.
Needless to say, a Factual Search reveals an incredible amount of failed fact checks. Below is a short list of the many failed facts racked up by Alex Jones of Infowars.
Says explosive devices mailed to prominent Democrats and Trump critics confirm the “deep state (is) launching false flag against (mainstream media)/Dems to blame Trump & pro-America forces.” – FALSE
Says there won’t be a recount in Alabama because a Democratic judge said “we’re going to erase all the computer files … on Wednesday morning.” – PANTS ON FIRE
Emails show Democrats, Hillary Clinton and George Soros instigated and orchestrated racial protests in Charlottesville by trying to “control” and keep people “desperate.” – PANTS ON FIRE
Says police officers smoke marijuana once a year as part of their jobs. – FALSE
“Election fraud: Democrats are voting twice in Maryland” – PANTS ON FIRE

According to their about page they state  “We believe in upholding family values, truth, respect, and tradition. Our stories help you celebrate the past, enjoy the present, and plan for the future. These are the stories that make you feel. These are the stories that matter.” 
American Web Media completely lacks transparency as they do not name an editor or owner, further author names appear fictitious and do not offer bios. For example, one author is just called “Alice”, with no other information provided.

Founded in 2013, American Web Media or AWM.com is a clickbait website that repackages news stories with the intent of clicks and social media sharing. According to their about page they state  “We believe in upholding family values, truth, respect, and tradition. Our stories help you celebrate the past, enjoy the present, and plan for the future. These are the stories that make you feel. These are the stories that matter.” 
American Web Media completely lacks transparency as they do not name an editor or owner, further author names appear fictitious and do not offer bios. For example, one author is just called “Alice”, with no other information provided.

Analysis / Bias
In review, AWM reproduces news stories that are broken down into the following categories: Animals, Bizarre, Family, Food and Inspire. Headlines are typically sensationalized to promote clicks such as this: Parents Are Furious After Homeless Take Over An Area Outside Of A California School. While this story offers supposed pictures, there isn’t any form of sourcing to back the headline. In another sensational story Rosie O’Donnell Accuses Donald Trump Of Having Sex With Ivanka, there is again a complete lack of sourcing. Politically, AWM leans right with stories such as these
A factual search reveals a few failed fact checks.

Rapture News Network was founded by Teresa, in her own words: “is a Christian wife, mother and grandmother residing in Honolulu, Hawaii, though she first found Jesus in 1971, it wasn’t until 2009, when she was diagnosed with lung cancer that she found Jesus again.“

Analysis / Bias
The Rapture News Network (Teresa) primarily makes extreme conspiratorial and pseudoscientific claims. For example, she claims the end of the world is coming soon, which is sourced from another far right christian website: “Pre-Tribulation Rapture, Prophecy, Signs and Warnings”. They also delve into right wing conspiracies such as this.  Rapture News Network routinely uses poor right wing sources such as the Daily Wire to promote a right wing agenda. Lastly, this source is very anti-Islam and uses the bible as evidence.

World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Live Action is an American anti-abortion non-profit organization founded in 2003 by then 15 year-old Lila Rose. Live Action is known for its undercover video sting operations on Planned Parenthood clinics. According to their about page “Live Action News reports daily on stories the mainstream media often refuses to cover — including exposés of the abortion industry and stories revealing the dignity and humanity of preborn children — inspiring our readers to defend the most vulnerable within their communities.”
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
According to the Live Action website “in 2008, Live Action was legally formed as a non-partisan, non-profit organization.” The website and organization are funded through donations.
Analysis / Bias
Live Action’s sole mission is to discredit Planned Parenthood and to advocate for Pro-Life policies. Typically, they try to achieve this through undercover sting videos. They also have a news section on their website that uses loaded emotional language such as this “Women in California may soon be protected from abortionists like these.” Generally, news articles are well sourced to credible information.
Critics of Live Action have accused them of selective video editing and publication of misleading information. A factual search reveals a few failed fact checks and misleading claims:
Does Planned Parenthood Provide No Prenatal Care, Only Abortions? – Mostly False
Does Planned Parenthood Enforce ‘Abortion Quotas’? – Unproven
An infant who survived abortion in a Polish hospital screamed for an hour while left alone to die. – Unproven
“Abortion is more dangerous now than ever before.” – False
Overall, we rate Live Action a moderate conspiracy website based on misleading and sometimes false accusations against Planned Parenthood and Pro-choice advocates. (1/31/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/13/2019)

Notes: Speisa is a website that publishes sensational stories. The owner/editor of the website is unknown. According to their about page Speisa describes its content as “posts are not satire, as lots of real, really strange stuff are happening in this strange world. Some news are funny, some are sad, and some are plain horrific.”
Speisa publishes anti-Muslim articles such as “Geldof to house four Syrian families.” They report this news story factually at first, and then interject anti-Muslim commentary such as these quotes: “Then it will be Geldof wearing an orange jump suit, ready to be beheaded on video and broadcasted via Raqqa. Ignorant Geldof will finally be able to see how Islam plays out.” This generalization of Syrian refugees indicates extreme bias against Muslims.
Speisa also publishes sensational click bait headlines that focuses on a variety of topics mostly with emotionally loaded headlines and content such as “Obamagate: Photo shows Obama’s ties to radical Islam.” Speisa frequently uses factually mixed sources such as The Daily Caller and Daily Mail. Overall, this site is a questionable source due to publication of anti-Muslim propaganda and poor sourcing with an extreme right wing bias. (M. Huitsing 1/29/2018)

Spain won that year.”
In review, most of The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) content is dedicated to the activities of Kim Jong-un such as “Kim Jong Un Praised in Nepal” and typically they use emotionally loaded language and publish poorly sourced articles such as this one: “U.S. Aegis Destroyer Deployed around Korean Peninsula.” In this article they source their claim with a vague statement without a link or a name of the source: “Foreign press says that the U.S. deployment of the destroyer is aimed to intensify military pressure upon the DPRK”
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) employ negative language, towards the nations that are seen as critical towards North Korea such as in this quote: “The article, authored by the notorious reptile journalist, is run through with lies told by the scum of society, and it was carried by the Tokyo head office of the newspaper.”

She is a foremost defender of the freedom of speech against attempts to force the West to accept Sharia blasphemy laws, and against Sharia self-censorship by Western media outlets.”  The American Freedom Defense Initiative, is an anti-Muslim, pro-Israel American organization known primarily for its controversial, Islamophobic advertising campaigns.

In 2010, Pamela Geller began a controversial campaign to stop the construction of a mosque at the 9-11 ground zero site, and in 2015, Ms. Geller proposed a drawing contest of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, which is forbidding in Islam.

Finally, the website promotes conspiracy theories as evidenced by this statement: “the Fed’s counterfeiting finances the tools of the government’s oppression over you: the militarization of the police, the surveillance apparatus, and the endless wars.” While this could possibly be true, there is not evidence to support such a claim, therefore it is a conspiracy theory until such evidence exists.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Religion of Peace promotes anti-Muslim propaganda through only posting negative information about Islam, such as crimes that may not be related to ones religion, such as this where they link to a Mixed factual source. On the homepage they keep a running count of terror attacks as well as people killed by Muslims in what they call the Jihad Report. Along the right side of the page they publish curated news from a variety of sources. Some of these sources are on our questionable or conspiracy list such as Breitbart, Daily Mail, and MEMRI. However, for the most part, most news links to credible right and left leaning sources such as the BBC and local newspapers, with the common theme of reporting negative news regarding Muslims.
Overall, we rate The Religion of Peace as Questionable for having an extreme right wing bias, promotion of conspiracy/propaganda, lack of transparency and anti-Islam tendencies. (D. Van Zandt 9/15/2017) Updated (9/16/2019)

Founded in 2016, The National Pulse is a Washington-based political news and news media publication. The National Pulse promotes a conservative line on a wide range of issues such as Planned Parenthood, LGBT, and Common Core. The National Pulse is also affiliated with the questionable American Principles Project which advocates for immigration reform, banning abortions, and denying LGBTQ equal rights.

The National Pulse is owned by The American Principles Project (APP), which is a 501(c)(3) think tank founded in 2009 by Robert George, Jeff Bell, and Frank Cannon. APP promotes a combination of libertarian and socially conservative policies. The Southern Poverty Law Center has accused American Principles Project of promoting conspiracies but has not formally labeled them a hate group. Revenue is derived through advertising and donations to the APP.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The National Pulse’s reporting regarding politics uses strong emotional loaded words such as in this article “LGBT Activists Spending Big to Elect Transgender Candidate in Virginia.” They also only cover one side of the story that favors their conservative causes. Although they do source their articles, it is typically to far-right sources that have poor track records with fact-checkers.
Editorially, they promote conservative policies such as anti-immigration, anti-abortion, and anti-gay marriage positions. They also frequently rail against Planned Parenthood such as this, 10 Disturbing Facts from Planned Parenthood’s (Late) Annual Report. Finally, The National Post occasionally promotes conspiracy theories such as this: EXCLUSIVE: CCP-Linked Firm Targets U.S. Schoolkids With Chinese ‘Morality and Values’, Shows CCP Military Parades in Schools. While elements of this article are true, the author claims “In light of coronavirus, virtual learning is the only remaining avenue for the CCP to turn American school children into 21st century little red guards”, which simply is not supported by evidence. This is a conspiracy theory created by the author. In general, news and commentary contain extreme right perspectives that occasionally promote conspiracy theories, while the parent organization has made false claims.

The author of the study states “GMOs alone may not cause the effects and that it was important to note that other contaminants may have played part in the issues encountered.”
Besides routinely publishing misleading pseudoscience articles, they also produce conspiracy stories related to 9-11. When we previously reviewed this website they had numerous conspiracy stories related to the WTC being brought down by a controlled demolition. Those stories have been removed. 
A factual search reveals numerous failed fact checks. Below are just a few.

Notes: Covert Geopolitics is a news and opinion website that tends to focus on numerous conspiracies. For example on 3/22/17 a terrorist attack occurred in London. Without evidence, Covert Geopolitics proclaimed this a False Flag operation. In another case they claim HAARP was used to create a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Indonesia as revenge for resisting Khazarian demands.

For example: “CIA Official Reveals Obama’s Shadow Government’s Plan To Take Down America “ and “Clinton Foundation On Brink Of Collapse As Huge Corporations Halt Donations.” Unique Web Magazine also promotes conspiracies and pseudoscience diets that originate from unscientific sources.
