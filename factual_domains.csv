Analysis / Bias
In review, the Poynter website features news related to the press and news industry. Headlines utilize mild to moderate loaded emotional language such as this: Across the world, politicians promote conspiracy theories to get ahead. This story is properly sourced to scientific studies as well as the Least Biased Reuters. Poynter also established the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN), which established a code of principles for fact checking. In order to be a signatory of the IFCN a media source must apply and adhere to their guidelines. Further, Poynter owns the fact checker Politifact, which is also a part of the IFCN. In general, Poynter reports news with low bias and proper sourcing.
A factual search reveals they have not failed fact check. However, in May of 2019, Poynter published an article called UnNews, which listed 515 media source they deemed not reliable. This article was met with criticism due to the list containing some biased, but credible sources. Within two days, Poynter retracted the article and issued an apology.

World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
The LA Times, originally called the Los Angeles Daily Times, was founded by Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner in 1881. The LA Times was acquired by then Editor/publisher Harrison Gray Otis. In 1885, Harry Chandler, who had been hired initially as a circulation department clerk, become Harrison Otis’ son in law. Under Chandler and Otis the paper was anti-union, which led to the 1910 bombing of the LA Times building, resulting in the deaths of 21 employees. In 1944, Norman Chandler succeeded his father Harry Chandler and in the 1960’s, Norman’s son Otis Chandler became the owner and publisher of the LA Times. Otis Chandler “transformed the Los Angeles Times from a conservative paper into a Pulitzer Prize-winner.” It was under Otis Chandler that the paper won its first of 44 Pulitzer Prizes.
In June 2000, Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Tribune, acquired Times Mirror Co., parent company of the LA Times, which ended “100 years of local ownership of The Times by the Otis and Chandler families.”
In 2018, Biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong acquired LA Times for $500m from the Tribune Publishing Company (formerly Tronc) and became the owner and executive chairman of the Los Angeles Times. Former Vice Chairman of Time inc., Norman Pearlstine is the Executive Editor. See the Masthead for a complete list of the editorial team.
The LA Times covers local/national news, business, entertainment, political analysis and sports news. The LA Times is headquartered in Los Angeles, California.

Biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is the owner of LA Times. The paper is funded through advertising, subscriptions and newsstand sales.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the LA Times (Los Angeles Times) uses moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as this “Outgoing White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly defends his rocky tenure” and “Engaging with the world doesn’t make Americans ‘suckers’”  The wording within articles also tends to lean left as evidenced by this quote from an editorial “Congress needs to focus not only on how amateurishly Trump executes foreign policy but the clear shortcomings of the policy itself.” When it comes to sourcing the LA Times rarely uses hyperlinked sourcing, which is acceptable as news stories are covered and written by their journalists. When using hyperlinked sources they utilize credible ones such as the Financial Times.
Editorially, the LA Times has endorsed Democratic Presidential Candidates in the last three elections and during 2016 General Election the LA Times stated that “Hillary Clinton would make a sober, smart and pragmatic president. Donald Trump would be a catastrophe.”  
In a 2018 Interview, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong told NPR “We’ll be as competitive vis-à-vis the The New York Times and The Washington Post.”

Analysis / Bias
In review, Fast Company reports news via interviews and original journalism focusing on Tech, Work Life and to a lesser extent politics. Headlines and articles typical contain minimal to moderate loaded language such as this: New Belgium Brewery’s employees think like owners. Because they are. This story is properly sourced to a Rutgers Institute Study. When it comes to reporting on politics, Fast Company often reports negatively on the Trump administration, such as this: The fake video of Trump gunning down journalists isn’t the problem—Trump’s rhetoric is. While most stories are more favorable toward left leaning candidates they also report somewhat critically on them as well: 9 funny memes from the fourth Democratic debate to help you laugh and not cry. In general, from a political standpoint, Fast Company leans left with more favorable reporting on liberal issues and candidates.

According to an ipsnews article, El Nuevo Dia is a member of The Inter American Press Association (IAPA) with a quote from the article that reads “El Nuevo Día is a member of the Inter American Press Association (IAPA), an organisation that has frequently been accused of right-wing bias and political activism.” Further, Luis A. Ferré, who was the owner of El Nuevo Dia, was also the founder of New Progressive Party.
In review, El Nuevo Dia publishes articles with minimally emotionally loaded language such as these: “Leaked chat between Puerto Rico’s governor and his executive team shakes the island” and “A cry for statehood”.
Further, they also publish tabloid style articles such as “Residents of a Dominican community catch a crocodile and sacrifice it”. When it comes to sourcing, often El Nuevo Dia hyperlinks to itself as well as to some domestic sources, which we do not know the credibility status, such as sertelnoticias and credible sources such as the Associated Press. When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a critical tone such as in this article “Another rebuff to the island”.

History
Founded in 1843, The Economist is an English-language weekly news magazine that is edited in London, UK. The current editor is Zanny Minton Beddoes. According to their about page The Economist “is neither right nor left but a blend of the two, drawing on the classical liberalism of the 19th century and coming from what we like to call the radical centre.”

Funded by / Ownership
The Economist is owned by the Economist Group, which is a British multinational media company. The Economist Group is primary owned by the Cadbury, Rothschild, Schroder, Layton and Agnelli families. The Economist is funded through subscriptions, advertising and sponsored content.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Economist takes an editorial stance of classical and economic liberalism that supports free trade, globalization, open immigration, and social liberalism. There is minimal use of loaded language in both headlines and articles such as this: America’s new attitude towards China is changing the countries’ relationship. In fact, most articles are well written with very low emotional bias. Economically, The Economist leans right, but they also support such initiatives as a carbon tax and environmental protectionism, which are not right wing positions. Editorially, The Economist endorses both Republicans and Democrats in the United States. For example, the have endorsed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2016, while endorsing Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush in earlier elections. In the UK they most recently endorsed the Liberal Democrats, which hold left leaning libertarian positions. One criticism of The Economist is that a majority of their articles are penned anonymously, which they explain is to maintain a continuity of writing. They do however, provide a media directory where you can view who is involved in writing and editing.
A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 59% of the Economist’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 24% Mixed and 18% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that the Economist is preferred by a more liberal audience.
A factual search reveals that The Economist has never failed a fact check.

Both magazine and website have an editorial focus on news, politics, opinion, and arts and entertainment of interest to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) people. The current editor is Zach Stafford. The website provides a staff page, but does not offer biographies, thereby lacking some transparency.

The Advocate is owned by Pride Media, which publishes several LGBT interest publications. Revenue is derived from magazine subscriptions and advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Advocate reports news related to the LGBT community. Original reporting often uses minimal loaded language such as this: Gay Diplomat Nominated as Ambassador to Conservative Lithuania. This story, like most are properly sourced to credible media outlets such as whitehouse.gov, France24, and the Daily Beast. The website offers news under the “Culture” category as well as Politics. News reported under the politics tab often favor the left, such as this: New Campaign Highlights Major Companies Backing Antigay Politicians. Again, this story is properly sourced to information from the least biased Open Secrets.
Editorially, they offer a Commentary section that features op-eds. Most op-eds again favor the left, and are not favorable to President Donald Trump: The Unclean Hands of Donald J. Trump. In general, most stories favor the left through advocacy for progressive liberal policy.

History
The Mirror or The Daily Mirror is a British Tabloid that was founded by Alfred Harmsworth (Lord Northcliffe) in 1903. Originally, the main audience was women. It was described as a newspaper for gentlewomen, however it was not successful, therefore it moved to a broader focus. Its new editor Hamilton Fyfe converted the paper into a photo rich format using photojournalism. The paper’s next owner was Alfred Harmsworth’s brother Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, who is also known to be an admirer of Mussolini and supporter of Nazi Germany. In 1935, Lord Rothermere sold his shares in the newspaper to H. G. Bartholomew and Hugh Cudlipp, with the paper becoming a left-wing working-class newspaper. In 1951, Cecil King replaced Bartholomew as chairman, however he was sacked in 1968, when he began using the newspaper to attack the head of the Labour Party, Harold Wilson. Currently Reach plc is the owner and Alison Phillips is the current Editor.

The Daily Mirror uses pictures as the main feature of the story with the pages mainly covered by photographs. However, they are also known to use fake photographs, which caused its editor Piers Morgan to resign. The Guardian has also revealed that The Daily Mirror used a misleading stock photo that misrepresented the story.
In review, The Mirror uses emotionally loaded sensational headlines and content that is oversimplified such as “School sends girl, 5, home in different outfit and asks her to ‘cover her body.” The source for this story is a Facebook post. Further, the paper has a section called “mums” that also presents sensational headlines such as this: “Woman goes on romantic holiday with boyfriend – and returns with lesbian love.” When it comes to world news pertaining to the USA, they publish articles with emotionally loaded anti-Trump toned headlines such as “Donald Trump WON’T be allowed to stay at Buckingham Palace during UK state visit.”  In general, articles are poorly sourced and written in a “gossip” style.  When it comes to British news, again The Mirror rarely use hyperlinks to source others, instead sourcing back to themselves.
Politically, The Mirror publishes anti-Brexit articles such as “The Brexit Zombies are going to eat this country alive.” While they do criticize the Labor Party, they did endorse them in the last election. Lastly, according to YouGov.com its political stance in the UK is known as left of center.

Military.com is owned by Monster Worldwide, which is a subsidiary of Randstad Holding, a Dutch multinational human resource consulting firm headquartered in Diemen, Netherlands. Revenue is primarily generated through advertising. 
Analysis / Bias
In review, Military.com provides news as well as information about services to service members. There are separate news sections for Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and the Coast Guard. The website offers original reporting that is factual and low biased in wording such as this: Army Identifies Reserve Soldier Killed in Syria Vehicle Rollover. However, the majority of content comes from other outlets such as the Associated Press and Stars and Stripes, both of which we rate as least biased. 
Editorially, there is a section called “opinion” that tends to present balanced viewpoints such as this from a right leaning perspective, The Case for Pulling US Troops Out of Africa, and this from a left leaning perspective Betrayal of the Kurds Is a Stain on American Honor. When reporting on President Trump, Military.com typically sticks to the facts, but sometimes they do not agree with his foreign policy. In general, they report factually and with minimal bias.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

History
The Washington Post (WaPo), headquartered in Washington D.C., was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins. He was a journalist, publisher and passionate Democrat that later became a Missouri state representative for the Democratic Party and operated The Post until 1889. Republican financier Eugene Meyer bought The Washington Post in 1946. After Meyer stepped down to become head of the Federal Reserve, his son-in-law, Philip Graham, became publisher. In 1947, after Philip Graham committed suicide, his wife, Katharine Meyer Graham took over the Washington Post Company. She was the first female publisher of a major American newspaper. Her son, Donald Graham, became publisher in 1979. Donald Graham, was the chairman of The Post before selling it to Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Katharine Weymouth, a granddaughter of Katharine Meyer Graham and niece of Donald Graham served as the publisher of The Washington Post until her resignation in 2014. Currently, Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the founder of Politico and a former Reagan administration official is the Publisher and CEO of The Post. Martin Baron is the executive editor.

In 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million. Bezos is a frequent target of Trump, who has accused the businessman of using the Postal System as its “Delivery Boy.” The newspaper’s executive editor, Martin Baron said Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, is not involved in its news coverage. According to a NY Magazine article “Bezos is libertarian who has given money to anti-tax initiatives in the past” and supports gay marriage through donations. Bezos also donated to both Democratic and Republican Senators respectively.
Analysis / Bias
The Washington Post played a part with The New York Times in publishing excerpts of the Pentagon Papers in 1971. The original papers can be viewed Here. The WaPo started reporting on Watergate in 1972, linking the DNC break-in to Nixon’s campaign and eventually brought down the administration of President Richard Nixon. 
According to Pew Research, the Washington Post is more trusted by a liberal readers than conservatives. However, in 2016, The Washington Post published an anti-Bernie Sanders editorial “Bernie Sanders’s fiction-filled campaign” that the New Republic called an “embarrassment.”
The WaPo was involved in a scandal in 1980, when they published an article by Janet Cooke that won the Pulitzer Prize. Cooke later returned the Pulitzer Prize when it turned out the story was not true.
In review, The Washington Post publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “Trump escalates China trade war, announces plan for tariffs on $200 billion in products” and in editorials “The Trump administration created this awful border policy. It doesn’t need Congress to fix it.” When it comes to sourcing they typically utilize credible sources such as Propublica.org, Associated Press, Slate, Princeton.edu, New York Times, wired.com and CNN. Story selection and editorials tend to favor the left with the Washington Post only endorsing Democratic Presidential candidates since 1976, including Hillary Clinton in the last election. The Washington Post has also been accused of having an anti-Progressive bias, with numerous op-eds negative toward Bernie Sanders.

History
Founded in 2005, Newsbusters claims to expose liberal bias much like its parent organization Media Research Center. The website features a tagline that reads “dedicated to exposing & combating liberal media bias.” Essentially, this site reports on perceived liberal bias in the media and by individuals. According to their about page, they state “the NewsBusters blog provides immediate exposure of national media bias, unfairness, inaccuracy, and occasional idiocy.” 
The parent organization, Media Research Center (MRC) was founded in 1987 by L. Brent Bozell III. MRC claims to be “America’s leading media watchdog in documenting, exposing and neutralizing liberal media bias.”
On 12/18/2019 Newsbusters published a misleading criticism of Media Bias Fact Check stating “MediaBiasFactCheck.com has one section labelled “Questionable Sources,” which includes neo-Nazi publications such as The Daily Stormer, but also slams reputable conservative outlets: DNC Starts Disinformation ‘Intelligence Unit’ To Combat Drudge, CNSNews.com.” While it is a fact that there are numerous conservative/far right sources on our questionable list, Newsbusters failed to mention the dozens of left wing sources on this list such as Occupy Democrats, Bipartisan Report, Blue Dot Daily etc. This story illustrates clearly the bias and misleading nature of Newsbusters and hence why this is a borderline Questionable source.
Funded by / Ownership
Newsbusters is owned by the Media Research Center, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. The MRC has received financial support from several right leaning sources, including the Bradley, Scaife, Olin, Castle Rock, Carthage and JM foundations, as well as ExxonMobil. Newsbusters is funded by MRC and also displays advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Newsbusters reports news on liberal bias. They frequently use strongly loaded, emotional and right biased wording such as this: CBS’s Garrett Hammers NBC for Boosting Warren During Debate. This story is sourced to video footage and tweets. Another example of emotionally charged language can be found here: NBC’s Liberal Debate Obsessions: Save Miami! Grab Guns! Fight Mitch McConnell! When it comes to sourcing they usually provide video to support their opinions, however other times they use poor sources such as Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart. Editorially, Newsbusters always favors conservatives and denigrates the left.

In review, the KUOW-NPR website reports news and radio programming information with minimal bias. News on the website is derived from NPR and often utilizes minimal loaded language such as this House Democrats Unveil 2 Articles Of Impeachment Against Trump. This story is fact based and cites quotations and first person accounts. In general, story selection tends to slightly lean left, through some negative coverage of President Trump and positive coverage of Democrats, but there is a consistent credible balance.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate KUOW-NPR Left-Center Biased based on story selection that slightly favors the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 5/18/2016) Update (12/10/2019)

Analysis / Bias
VoxEurop (English) describes Helsingin Sanomat’s reporting as “apolitical, with essentially “straight” news reporting and close coverage of current events abroad.”
Editorially, Helsingin Sanomat strongly advocates for Climate action. They also ran a campaign selling ugly sweaters that promotes environmentalism and brings attention to social justice issues such as sexual harassment. 
In review, when covering national news, Helsingin Sanomat appears to have a neutral tone towards the Center-Left PM of Finland Sanna Marin: “In her New Year greeting to Prime Minister Sanna Marin: Finland is coping with learning new things.” They also tend to cover Jussi Halla-aho, the leader of the Finns Party (nationalist populist right wing party), with minimally loaded emotional language such as here. Recently, Helsingin Sanomat was strongly criticized by Eurosceptic right leaning Center Party MP Mikko Kärnä for publishing a full-page pro-China advertisement on Hong Kong on its front page. Helsingin Sanomat responded by stating that they also published advertisements supporting the Hong Kong protesters. The paper has also been criticized for a lack of diversity. When covering the USA they have an anti-Trump tone as they lined billboards on Trump’s motorcade route with ads stating “Mr. President, Welcome to the Land of Free Press.”
When it comes to sourcing of information they utilize credible sources such as the New York Times, Helsinki Times, The Guardian, and BBC.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

Funded by / Ownership
WBZ-TV / CBS Boston is a subsidiary of ViacomCBS, which is owned by National Amusements, Inc. They are operated by the third generation leadership of the Redstone family. The President of National Amusements, and chairwomen of the company is Shari Ellin Redstone. Revenue is derived through advertising.
On 7/27/2018 a news story broke that alleges sexual misconduct allegations against former president Mr. Moonves. CBS wrote a response to the allegations stating they will be “taken seriously”.  
Analysis / Bias
In review, WBZ-TV / CBS Boston utilizes emotionally loaded headlines such as “Massachusetts To Sue Trump Administration Over Rollback Of Endangered Species Act” However, CBS Boston always sources their information to credible sources such as the Associated Press and covers the opposition critically as well. For example, in this interview they are critical of Democratic Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, “Elizabeth Warren Says Killing Of Iran General Part Of ‘Escalating’ Attacks From Trump”. A quote from the article reads “That non-response was typical of Warren’s campaign-long reluctance to engage with Sanders (and he with her).” Although this story highlights an interview with Warren, the author provides critical opinions regarding her campaign strategies for President.
A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 40% of CBS News’ audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 39% Mixed and 20% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that CBS News is preferred by a more liberal audience.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate WBZ-TV / CBS Boston Left-Center biased based on story selection that moderately favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (M. Huitsing 1/11/2020)

Funded by / Ownership
The Hill is published by Capitol Hill Publishing, which is owned by News Communications, Inc. Jimmy Finkelstein is the current CEO of New Communications who is described as a “Republican and longtime friend who served as a fundraiser for Giuliani’s failed 2008 presidential run.” The paper and website are funded through a subscription and advertising model.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Hill covers both sides on the political spectrum and generally sources information properly, however they sometimes rush stories and have to change them after the fact.  The Hill rarely uses loaded words in their headlines and articles such as this: Trump says he won’t sign GOP’s compromise immigration bill. All news stories are sourced to either journalists in the field or credible media sources.
The Hill features editorial commentaries that provide a reasonably balanced group of columnist that consists of the following:
Brent Budowsky (Leans Left)
Lanny Davis (Leans Left)
John Feehery (Leans Right)
Mark Mellman (Slightly Left)
Katie Pavlich (Leans Right)
Bill Press (Leans Left)
John Solomon (Right) (No Longer with The Hill)
David Webb (Leans Right)
The Hill also features other outside opinion contributors such as Newt Gingrich among other prominent figures. The general overall tone of all op-ed’s taken together is currently balanced after dominant right-leaning voice John Solomon left the paper in October 2019.
The Hill has faced criticism for the hiring of John Solomon, who is described as a strong supporter of President Trump and a conspiracy theorist, with his previous opinion columns under review for false content. Further, it has been reported that owner Jimmy Finkelstein “kept a watchful eye on the newspaper’s coverage to ensure it is not too critical of the President.”
In general, news reporting is balanced and factual with a reasonably balanced Op-Ed page.
A factual search reveals The Hill has not failed any fact checks. However, it should be noted that they have rushed to publish breaking news that needed to be corrected or removed in the past. The Hill has also published editorial commentary that has been labeled conspiratorial by other sources, however, this columnist is no longer with the paper.
Overall, we rate The Hill Least Biased based on editorial positions that are currently balanced and news reporting that is low biased. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting, rather than High, due to previous opinion columns promoting unproven claims. (5/18/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 04/23/2020)

History
Founded in 1865, The Nation is an American weekly business magazine based in New York City. The Nation covers world and national news, politics, economy, arts, culture and more. The Nation considers itself as a continuation of William Lloyd Garrison’s anti-slavery newspaper, The Liberator.
The Nation’s founding publisher was Joseph H. Richards, and the Irish born American Journalist Edwin Lawrence Godkin, who had formerly worked as a correspondent of the London Daily News and editor of the New York Evening Post.  After the Nation was sold to the New York Evening Post, Godkin became editor of the Post, a position he held until his retirement in 1899. Wendell Phillips Garrison, son of William Lloyd Garrison, was Literary Editor from 1865 to 1906. The Nation was bought by newspaperman-turned-railroad-baron Henry Villard in 1881 and The Nation became a weekly supplement for the New York Evening Post (Later it became the New York Post). After Henry Villard, his son, Oswald Garrison Villard, would became the new owner in 1900.
The Nation masthead states that it is edited and published by Katrina vanden Heuvel. Richard Kim is Executive Editor and the President is Erin O’Mara. According to their about page the magazine describes itself as “Principled. Progressive”.

In review, The Nation reports news with emotionally loaded words and bias such as “Judge Kavanaugh: An Originalist With a New—and Terrifying—Interpretation of Executive Power” and “It’s Time to Disrupt NATO, But not for the reasons Trump gives.”
Typically, The Nation utilizes credible sources such as the Associated Press and The Chronicle of Higher Education, however they also source through large quotes as well.

Funded by / Ownership
The Foundation for Economic Education is a nonprofit 501(c)(3). They fully disclose their finances on the website. According to the left leaning watchdog Sourcewatch, Fee has connections to the Koch Brothers. Further, the Least Biased Public Integrity also ties this organization to the Koch Bothers via funding.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Foundation for Economic Education advocates for small government, deregulation and low taxation, while also supporting civil liberties such as gay marriage and marijuana legalization, in which they proclaim prohibition is “racist.” FEE uses moderately loaded words in headlines that economically favor the right, such as their consistent opposition to the minimum wage: How Not to Argue Against the Minimum Wage. When it comes to science, FEE does not align with the consensus of science regarding climate change. While FEE does not deny that climate change is occurring, they do dispute the consensus regarding human impacts and the possible consequences of lack of action. In general, FEE is socially left as are most Libertarians and fiscally far right. 
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate The Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) Right-Center biased based on left leaning views regarding social issues and far right views pertaining to economics. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting based on not supporting the consensus of science regarding climate change. (D. Van Zandt 7/14/2016) Updated (4/30/2019)

Maclean’s is now owned by St. Joseph Communications, which is a media company based in Toronto, Canada. Maclean’s is funded through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Maclean’s covers social issues, politics and Canadian news through the use of journalists. News stories typically use minimal loaded words such as this: What a trade war with China would do to Canada. This story is properly sourced to the Globe and Mail and Reuters. When covering political issues Maclean’s provides a reasonable balance such as this: Ottawa and provinces pause carbon tax fight to battle plastic. Editorially, they also tend to give both sides, however many more favor the left: The bankruptcy of the Conservative Party.  Further, many opinion pieces are center around climate change and the action that they feel needs to occur: Trudeau should try walking the walk on climate change. In general, news reporting is factual and with minimal bias, however editorials lean left.

In 2007, the then St. Petersburg Times launched IFCN fact checker Politifact, which also won a Pulitzer for fact checking. In 2018, Politifact was acquired by Poynter Institute.

Poynter is funded by a wide range of donors including The Charles Koch Foundation on the Right and Open Societies Foundation on the Left. The newspaper generates revenue through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Tampa Bay Times publishes original news and investigative reporting covering the Tampa Bay and Florida region. National and International news is republished through the Associated Press. Original local and state news is delivered with minimal bias in wording and story selection such as this: Motorcyclist hospitalized, lanes closed after accident on U.S. 19 in Pinellas Park. When covering political news they often report with neutral wording such as this: Ron DeSantis endorses Florida bills allowing college athletes to make money.
Editorially, The Tampa Bay Times typically endorses Democratic candidates. For example, they have endorsed the Democratic Presidential Candidate every time since 1980. Further, in local elections, such as 2018, they endorsed all Democratic candidates. A review of the Opinion section also reveals a left leaning bias with most editorials favorable to liberal polices such as this: Two steps up, one step back on Florida voting rights | Editorial. In general, The Tampa Bay Times reports news factually and with minimal bias, however, editorially they lean moderately left.

While Time Magazine is clearly biased in favor of left leaning causes, they display a strong anti-Trump bias with daily articles denigrating his policies and actions. It is important to note that holding an anti-Trump bias is not necessarily a pro-left wing bias as many centrist and right-center sources also report against President Trump’s character and policies.
A factual search reveals that Time Magazine has never failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Time Magazine Left-Center biased based on story selection that mostly favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. This update moves Time further to the left with their bias rating score increasing from 3.75/10 to 4.75/10, which is on the cusp of Left and Left-Center Bias. (5/18/2016) Updated (D.

In 2001, FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), a progressive media watchdog group criticized NPR for favoring Israel. FAIR also states “NPR is definitely skewing right.” Tim Groseclose, a professor in the Economics and Political Science Department at UCLA, and Jeff Milyo, an economics professor at the University of Missouri, reports NPR has liberal bias.

Finally, According to the Washington Post, NPR CEO Jarl Mohn has contributed to Democratic candidates in statewide races, including the campaign of Robert Reich, President Bill Clinton’s secretary of labor. 
In review, NPR (National Public Radio) uses moderately emotional loaded headlines such as this: “President Trump’s Description of What’s ‘Fake’ Is Expanding.” Generally, story selection favors the Left with stories such as these: “Rise Of LGBTQ Candidates Could Usher In A ‘Rainbow Wave’ In 2018” and Majority Of Americans Don’t Want Roe v. Wade Overturned. They also report right leaning opinion pieces such as this: A Free-Market Economy Keeps Capitalism Ticking.
NPR reports world news with neutral headlines such as “In Bangladeshi Camps, Rohingya Refugees Try To Move Forward With Their Lives. NPR typically sources their information to credible sources such as the Washington Post, maristpoll.marist.edu, ohchr.org, The Economist, UNICEF, New York Times and many more. NPR’s news reporting is consistently low biased, factual and covers both sides of issues. However, taken on a whole, NPR is favored by a liberal audience, which indicates programming and story selection tends to lean left to appeal to their core listeners. For example, A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 67% of NPR’s audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 21% Mixed and 12% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that NPR is strongly preferred by a more liberal audience.
A factual search reveals that NPR has not failed a fact check.

Founded in 2001, Mental Floss is a lifestyle and entertainment website that caters to a millennial audience. According to their about page “Mental Floss delivers smart, fun and shareable content in an upbeat and witty environment. An encyclopedia of everything, we answer life’s big questions and uncover stories so interesting our readers absolutely must share them.”
Funded by / Ownership
Mental Floss is owned by Minute Media, which is an international digital-first media company. Revenue is derived through advertising and sale of merchandise.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Mental Floss is pretty much what you would expect from the name of the site. Light news, entertainment news, human interest, heath and beauty tips, etc. In short, everything you’d expect from the Lifestyle section of your local paper. As such, it is better than average for this type of site. They do not publish hard news, nor should anyone expect them to. They do carry some light news, however, and what they do carry is factual and well sourced. Most of their external story links are to clickbait sites which, while less than I have seen on similar sites, do detract from the overall quality. While I will admit to a personal dislike for clickbait sites, I do understand why people carry them. They do help pay the bills, after all, and that’s something we can all relate to.

These media sources are moderately to strongly biased toward liberal causes through story selection and/or political affiliation.  They may utilize strong loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes), publish misleading reports and omit reporting of information that may damage liberal causes. Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy. See all Left Bias sources.
Overall, we rate the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Left biased based on strong environmental activism.

Funded by / Ownership
The Natural Resources Defense Council is a nonprofit that is funded through donations and grants. Although they provide tax documents, they do not list large donors, which indicates a lack of transparency. According to the right leaning Influence Watch which specifically monitors left leaning activist groups, they claim that they have received funding from the Energy Foundation, which promotes a new energy economy.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the NRDC publishes news and information related to the environment, climate change and sustainable energy. Information is broken into categories such as Our Work, which shows the topics they advocate for and how they do it. The next section links to experts in different fields such as energy, climate change and health. The last section is called Our Stories, which publishes both original articles written by NRDC staff as well republished work from OnEarth.
News articles utilize moderate loaded language such as this, Tackling Climate Change Through Diet Change, and are generally well sourced to credible outlets such as the New York Times and research journals.
Editorially, the environmental positions of the NRDC align with the left through concern for climate change, chemicals and conservation of resources. When reporting on the Trump Administration they frequently use loaded emotional language to portray Trump negatively such as this: Trump’s Cabinet of Horrors. On the flip side, they tend to report positively on Democrats who support climate action such as this: Secretary Clinton’s Announcement: A Shot of Adrenalin for Climate Talks.
When it comes to science the NRDC is generally pro-science and supports the consensus, however on some issues, such as GMO’s, they frequently report negatively or sow doubt without specifically stating it. Further, in 1989 the NRDC was involved in the “great apple scare“, where they claimed that the chemical Alar, applied to apple trees was a potent cancer causing agent. The result of this claim was a loss of 250 million dollars to the apple industry. The NRDC claimed that “the average pre-schooler’s exposure was estimated to result in a cancer risk 240 times greater than the cancer risk considered acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency following a full lifetime of exposure.” However, experts at the American Council on Science and Health and others countered that the tests that produced the Alar scare would have required children to drink 5,000 gallons of apple juice — per day. Other studies have concluded that Alar may produce cancer in 5 out of 1 million people, which statistically places it in the “probable” category for cancer. This does not change the fact the NRDC grossly exaggerated their claim.
Overall, we rate the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Left biased based on strong environmental activism. We also rate them Mostly Factual for reporting, rather than High due to the publication of misleading information regarding GMO’s and pesticides as well as a lack of transparency with funding. (D.

History
Founded in 1749 by Ernst Henrich Berling, Berlingske, formerly known as Berlingske Tidende, is a Danish tabloid newspaper, which is published by Berlingske Media A/S. Berlingske is based in Copenhagen, Denmark. The paper focuses on news, opinion, entertainment and business news.

Funded by / Ownership
Berlingske is published by Berlingske Media A/S, which is owned by Belgian publishing company DPG Media. Revenue is derived through advertising and subscriptions.
Analysis / Bias
The current Prime Minister and leader of the Social Democrats is Mette Frederiksen. They are considered Center-Left, as they are left on economics, whereas skeptical of globalization, neoliberalism and immigration.
In review, Berlingske often covers news on culture, art and society with sensational headlines and extensive use of images: “When the mother returned, her daughter said just one phrase: “I hate you”.  Berlingske also publishes political articles with emotionally loaded language, for example, when covering the recent British elections they use favorable emotionally loaded headlines for conservative Boris Johnson, such as this:  “The Boris Johnson Rule: Business can learn one thing from his big election victory.” They also publish articles critical of the Center-Right Venstre, Danmarks Liberale Parti leader Jakob Ellemann-Jensen such as: “Following the Armed Forces scandal: Ellemann’s proposal is called “utterly hopeless to implement.” On the issues they frequently publish anti-immigration and anti-Muslim articles such as “Ruud Koopmans has been researching integration for more than 20 years – and he cannot point to a single Western country that is successful in integrating Muslims.”
When it comes to sourcing, Berlingske often hyperlinks to themselves as well as local sources such as euvsdisinfo.eu and the Danish News Agency Ritzau. They also link to credible news sources such as BBC and Reuters. When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a favorable tone such as in this article: “The crucial blow to the war against Trump.”
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Berlingske Right-Center Biased based on editorial positions that moderately favor the right. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting, rather than High, due to the occasional use of poor sources and sensationalized headlines. (M. Huitsing 12/20/2019)

Editorially, the AJC has endorsed both Republicans and Democrats. For example, in recent history they endorsed Republican George W. Bush in 2000 and the Democratic candidates in 2004 and 2008, however in 2012 and 2016 they did not endorse a Presidential candidate. While Op-Ed’s cover both sides, more tend to lean left such as this: Opinion: Bipartisan hope for climate change lawmaking. In general, the AJC reports news factually and with minimal bias, while editorially there is a slight lean left.

History
Founded in 1986, by Newspaper Publishing, The Independent is a daily newspaper from the United Kingdom. The Independent was launched by former Telegraph staffers Andreas Whittam Smith, Matthew Symonds, and Stephen Glover.  It is headquartered in London. In 1990, The Independent on Sunday was launched and edited by Stephen Glover. In 1994, the founders left the paper and Ian Hargreaves became the editor of the paper. A year later Newspaper Publishing was restructured, with Mirror Group and Tony O’Reilly’s Independent News & Media (INM) becoming joint owners of Newspaper Publishing. In 1998, INM took full control of the The Independent. O’Reilly bought out the company for £30m and in 2010 and then Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev acquired The Independent. In 2016, the paper moved to a digital-only format. Simon Kelner is currently the editor-in-chief of the Independent titles. Andreas Whittam Smith, the founder of The Independent, has also joined the board of Independent Print Limited. In 2017, Saudi Businessman Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel bought a 30% stake in the Independent online newspaper.

Analysis / Bias
The Independent recently joined up with a media group that has close links to the Saudi royal family to launch websites across the Middle East. Its partnering with a publisher that has strong links to the Saudi government has been criticized by the Guardian.
In review, The Independent tends to publish stories utilizing minimally loaded language in their headlines such as: “Theresa May insists Brexit deal is not dead despite EU leaders refusing to make further concessions”  and US news “Mueller investigation: Special counsel attacks Flynn criticism of FBI interview”. The Independent also republishes news from other credible sources such as the Associated Press: “Five things you didn’t know about Germany’s diesel ban”. In general, most stories favor the left and tend to be sourced properly utilizing credible sources such as USA Today and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.
According to a 2017 survey conducted by You Gov UK, The Independent is viewed as having a center-left bias in reporting with 79% saying it was either Center or Left and only 21% saying it leaned right.

A thorough review of political coverage indicates that more stories favor the left such as this: Greta Thunberg Slams Davos Elites on Climate as Trump Takes Stage. In general, news is reported factually and with a slight left leaning bias in story selection.

Health Magazine typically does not use loaded language and they usually source their information to mostly credible sources. Some of the claims made by Health Magazine are not fully supported with scientific evidence. However, we are not rating this source pseudoscience because most of the information is credible. We are just suggesting caution when attempting their diets or natural cures.

History
The Christian Science Monitor (CSM) is an international news organization that delivers global coverage via its website, weekly magazine, daily news briefing, email newsletters, Amazon Kindle subscription, and mobile site. It was started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist. According to their about page “The Christian Science Monitor is an independent international news organization.  We want to help you to see news events as starting points for constructive conversations. We seek to cut through the froth of the political spin cycle to underlying truths and values. We want to be so focused on progress that together we can provide a credible and constructive counter-narrative to the hopelessness-, anger-, and fear-inducing brand of discourse that is so pervasive in the news.” The current editor is Mark Sappenfield.
The Christian Science Monitor has won seven Pulitzer Prizes and more than a dozen Overseas Press Club awards. Although the name contains the words Christian Science, the news reporting is generally not religious and those that are religious in nature are clearly labeled.

Christianity Today magazine is an evangelical Christian periodical that was founded in 1956 by Billy Graham and is based in Carol Stream, Illinois. The Washington Post calls Christianity Today, “evangelicalism’s flagship magazine.” The current editor is Mark Galli.
On 12/19/2019, the editor of Christianity Today wrote an editorial highly critical of President Donald Trump: Trump Should Be Removed from Office. On 12/20/2019. President Trump responded via twitter:
A far left magazine, or very “progressive,” as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasn’t been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather…..have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion & your guns, than Donald Trump as your President. No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and it’s not even close. You’ll not get anything from those Dems on stage. I won’t be reading ET again!

Reason Magazine is owned and published by the Reason Foundation, which is an American libertarian think tank founded in 1978. It is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization that is supported by donations and sale of its publications. Its largest donors are the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation ($1,522,212) and the Sarah Scaife Foundation ($2,016,000), according to disclosures.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Reason Magazine utilizes moderately loaded emotional language in their headlines and articles such as this: The Winningest Losers in Trump’s Trade War. Although this article is clearly an opinion piece it does not provide hyperlinked sources to support its claims. In another article on their Hit and Run Blog titled: Trump Blames Hurricanes for Growing Budget Deficit. Entitlements Are the Real Problem they utilize numerous credible hyperlinked sources to support their claims.
Editorially, Reason takes Libertarian positions such as low taxes, free markets, low regulations and socially liberal position such as Marijuana legalization and pro-abortion rights. Politically, Reason falls within the Right-Center category based on economic positions (right) and socially liberal positions (Left). These positions often put Reason Magazine at odds with President Trump’s agenda regarding tariffs and free trade.
When it comes to low regulations, Reason Magazine resists taking action on climate change. Although they do not deny climate change is occurring and influenced by humans, they minimize the impact in favor of less regulations. 
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Reason Magazine Right-Center biased based on story selection that favors Libertarian positions and High for factual reporting due to mostly proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (7/16/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 2/05/2020)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Space.com covers developments in space, physics, technology and astronomy. Space.com does not offer original news, but rather summarizes news stories from other sources. News is reported with some emotional wording in headlines, but the body of content is generally pro-science such as this: A TV satellite is about to explode following ‘irreversible’ battery damage. Space.com always sources their information and does not provide significant editorial bias. For example, when reporting on Trump, they stick with the genre and focus on science issues such as this: Trump Launches US Space Command to Control the ‘Next Warfighting Domain’.

In review, the Knoxville News Sentinel utilizes local reporters for local news stories and republishes content from the Associated Press and USA Today for national news.

History
Founded in 1920, The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a nonpartisan, non-profit, organization  whose stated mission is “to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States.” It works through litigation, lobbying, and community empowerment.

The ACLU is a 501(c)4 non-profit corporation and is funded through donations.
Analysis / Bias
The ACLU in their blog section and even news section often cite to places like the Huffington Post for news articles but sometimes they will use basic reporting like AP or Reuters. Beyond their news and blog posts most of the site covers issues that are often considered more liberal causes but most often it is consistent with their stance on the rights they champion. The ACLU has defended the KKK, Pro Abortion, and Neo-Nazi’s right to assemble and protest (1 2 3).  They will often be accused of being left biased as they do not advocate for gun rights, however they equally do not champion gun regulations either.  A quick search for Gun Rights or even Guns will yield no results or results only related to search and seizure cases they have taken on.  They do not agree on the individuals rights to own firearms but do not advocate on their beliefs.  They have teamed up with the NRA several times in a sort of odd fellowship (4). Their Blog & News feed’s can often be filled with more left leaning stances, but they are not biased in their case work load or defending the rights they advocate for. There have been times Justice Scalia the most outspoken and most conservative justice at the time had ideas that line up with the ACLU (5). Most modern conservatives may often take issue with much of what the ACLU advocates and litigates in courts. However, the ACLU has defended religious freedoms in the school as well. Including the right to pray in school (6). I would try to advocate that the ACLU is more neutral than left, but with the major shift in American politics to the right, I can no longer advocate that stance.
A factual search reveals a few failed fact checks.
“When the country was founded, Congress had exactly the same attitude about the sanctity of Christmas celebrations that a 7-Eleven does today: ‘Yeah, we’re open.'” – Pants on Fire
Voter identification laws make it complicated and expensive to get an ID, essentially instituting a modern-day poll tax. – Mostly False
“Half the states in the U.S. have laws that criminalize criticism.” – Mostly False

History
PBS NewsHour is an American daily evening television news program that is broadcast on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), airing seven nights a week on more than 300 of the public broadcaster’s member stations. As the nation’s first hour-long nightly news broadcast, the program is known for its in-depth coverage of issues and current events.
PBS NewsHour was created by Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer.
In 2003, UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose and Missouri economist Jeff Milyo evaluated various media programs based on “think tank” citations to map liberal versus conservative media slants and published a study alleging liberal media bias in general. Based on their research, PBS NewsHour is the most centrist news program on television and the closest to a truly objective stance.

Funded by / Ownership
PBS NewsHour is funded through donations and sponsorship’s from individuals, foundations and corporations. PBS NewsHour offers full disclosure of funders here.
Analysis / Bias
In review, PBS NewsHour offers high quality in-depth journalism with minimal bias through wording. For example, these headlines and articles contain minimal bias:
Violence at the Venezuelan border, humanitarian aid blocked
Pentagon chief getting firsthand look at US-Mexico border
Shields and Brooks on Trump declaration, Bernie Sanders’ 2020 bid
PBS sources all information through quotes and/or hyperlinks and provides transcripts from videos on the website. PBS NewsHour has been criticized as being left biased by the right and as being in favor of corporations by the progressive left. In general, story selection and tone slightly favors the left when it comes to environmental issues and with moderately negative reporting of President Trump. One thing that is consistent with PBS NewsHour, their reporting is evidence based and accurate.
A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 60% of PBS’ audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 26% Mixed and 15% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that PBS is preferred by a more liberal audience.
A factual search reveals they have never failed a fact check.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The American Prospect reports original political news from a liberal perspective. Stories are well written and headlines contain moderately loaded language that favors the left such as this: The Republican War on the Capital Gains Tax. This story is very well sourced to the New York Times, Washington Post, Bloomberg and Whitehouse.gov. Economically, the American Prospect aligns with the progressive left with articles such as this: The 5 Biggest Corporate Lies About Unions. When it comes to science they support the consensus on climate change, vaccines and GMO’s.
Editorially, the American Prospect favors liberal positions, however they present information that is factual and evidence based.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the American Prospect Left Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that routinely favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 5/15/2016) Updated (9/8/2019)

When it comes to sourcing, Raw Story generally sources to credible media outlets such as the Washington Blade, Las Vegas Review-Journal, and the St. Louis Post Dispatch. In general, story selection always favors the left and frequently has an anti-Trump tone. Raw Story has published misleading articles that promote miracle cures such as this one: Scientists discover virus that kills all grades of breast cancer ‘within seven days’. This headline is misleading, as within the article they clearly state “but not in normal mammary epithelial cells.” When it comes to consensus science, they sometimes promote anti-GMO propaganda, however they also publish credible scientifically sound information as well.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Business Insider occasionally publishes listicles such as: “The top 10 Google searches of 2018” and “10 burning questions Americans asked Google in 2018.” Business Insider reports news and opinions with the use of moderately loaded words such as this: “Trump inexplicably told Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi that Mexico would pay for the border wall as part of the landmark new trade deal” and “China looks like it’s going to give Trump a huge symbolic trade war win, fueling hope for a big deal.”  When it comes to sourcing information they utilize credible media sources such as gbm.hsbc.com, brookings.edu, Bloomberg, Council on Foreign Relations , and asia.nikkei.com.
Politically, Business Insider leans left through both story selection and wording. Here are some examples of stories that have a leftward tilt:
The odds that a gun will kill the average American may surprise you
Mollie Tibbetts’ death is being used to push debunked ideas about illegal immigration and violent crime
Big oil companies were forced to lay out the science of climate change today in a court hearing that was compared to the Scopes trial on evolution
Ocasio-Cortez burns Mike Huckabee after being mocked: ‘Leave the false statements to Sarah Huckabee. She’s much better at it.’
This last story about Ocasio-Cortez and Mike Huckabee comes directly from the strongly left leaning Talking Points Memo.

National news comes from a variety of sources including the Associated Press and New York Times. All story information is properly sourced.

For example, this paper routinely publishes negative opinion pieces against Democratic Presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke. In general, the Dallas Morning News publishes straight news with minimal bias and demonstrates a slight right leaning bias editorially.

History
Founded in 1973 by Joseph Coors (Coors Brewery), The Heritage Foundation is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. The foundation took a leading role in the conservative movement during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whose policies were taken from Heritage’s policy study Mandate for Leadership.  Heritage has since continued to have a significant influence in U.S. public policy making, and is considered to be one of the most influential conservative research organizations in the United States.
The Heritage Foundation has been described as a major influence on the presidential transition of Donald Trump and the Trump administration. The foundation had a powerful say in the staffing of the administration, with CNN noting during the transition that “no other Washington institution has that kind of footprint in the transition.”
The Heritage Foundation also publishes the conservative news website, Daily Signal.

Heritage’s initial funding was provided by Joseph Coors, of the Coors beer empire, and Richard Mellon Scaife, heir of the Mellon industrial and banking fortune. The Heritage Foundation provides current financial information that you can view here. The Heritage Foundation currently receives funding through individual donations as well as grants from conservative organizations such as the Koch Family Foundations, Marlboro cigarette manufacture’s parent company Altria and the Bradley Foundation.  The Wall Street Journal also reported that between 1993 and 1996, heritage received almost $1 million from the Korea Foundation, which reportedly “serves as a direct conduit of money from the South Korean government.” A look at campaign donations by Heritage shows that 96%, since 1990 have gone to Republican candidates and causes.

The Heritage Foundation provides current financial information that you can view here. The Heritage Foundation currently receives funding through individual donations as well as grants from conservative organizations such as the Koch Family Foundations, Marlboro cigarette manufacture’s parent company Altria and the Bradley Foundation.  The Wall Street Journal also reported that between 1993 and 1996, heritage received almost $1 million from the Korea Foundation, which reportedly “serves as a direct conduit of money from the South Korean government.” A look at campaign donations by Heritage shows that 96%, since 1990 have gone to Republican candidates and causes.", USA,"Founded in 1973 by Joseph Coors (Coors Brewery), The Heritage Foundation is an American conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. The foundation took a leading role in the conservative movement during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, whose policies were taken from Heritage’s policy study Mandate for Leadership.

In review, Slate has a politically progressive, liberal stance throughout their political articles. They publish political news with moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as “The Government Shutdown Is Going to Hurt More People Each Day It Continues” and “EPA Proposes Nixing Obama-Era Rule on Mercury From Coal Plants.” Slate always sources to credible media outlets such as: Associated Press, Bloomberg, Reuters, The Hill,  Washington Post, and New York Times.

RealClear Investors and Crest Media is the owner of RealClearPolitics. John McIntyre is the Co-founder & CEO, Tom Bevan is the Co-founder & Publisher and Erin Waters is the President of the RealClear Media Group. According to Political Wire, RealClear operated a far right website by the name Conservative Country, while this website is no longer in existence the associated Facebook Page has 800,000+ followers. The Facebook Page publishes pro-Trump, anti-immigrant, Islamophobic, far right memes and information, many of which link back to RealClear properties. RealClear is funded through paid subscriptions and an online advertising model.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website features selected political news stories and op-eds from various news publications in addition to commentary from its own contributors. Though their own political views lean conservative, the site’s founders say their goal is to give readers “ideological diversity” in its commentary section. In reviewing their political news and opinions there are slightly more that are published from right leaning sources, however both sides are represented. Real Clear Politics is perhaps best known for their RCP Polling Average, which combines all polling data to create a statistical average.
Most of the news content on Real Clear Politics is aggregated from other sources such as: Washington Post, New York Post, Salon, Fox News, The Federalist and National Review. Several of the sources used by Real Clear Politics are listed as Mixed factual due to failed fact checks. For example in this article, the author claims that the Intelligence Community Inspector General must have a whistle blower complaint with “First Hand” information before it can be urgent and credible. This is a false claim.  In reviewing original Real Clear Politics articles, there is a right leaning bias in wording and story selection such as this: Gov. Jerry ‘Moonbeam’ Brown’s Warning to Fellow Democrats. Although this is an opinion piece, it completely lacks sourcing of any kind. In general, the majority of stories from Real Clear Politics comes from a right leaning perspective.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Real Clear Politics as Right-Center biased based on source selection that leans right. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting rather than High due to the use of some sources that have failed fact checks. (7/16/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 02/21/20)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Phoenix New Times reports news with minimal bias using credible media sources such as Indianapolis Star, LA Times, and Guttmacher Institute. However, they do use left leaning loaded language both in their headlines and articles when discussing social issues, such as “Birth-Control Advocates: Trump’s Policy Restricts Women, Not Religion” and “Healing the Wounds of Transgender Wars at the VA Hospital in Tucson.
A factual search reveals that the Phoenix New Times has never failed a fact check.

History
Founded in 1945, Commentary is a monthly American magazine on religion, Judaism, and politics, as well as social and cultural issues. Besides its strong coverage of cultural issues, Commentary, historically provided a strong voice for the anti-Stalinist left. Norman Podhoretz the founder, originally a liberal Democrat turned neoconservative, moved the magazine to the right and toward the Republican Party in the 1970s and 1980s. The current editor is John Podhoretz who is an American writer, a columnist for the New York Post, the author of several books on politics, and a former speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. The website also provides a masthead on their about page.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The magazine is owned by Commentary Inc., which is a nonprofit and serves as the publisher. Revenue is derived from print advertising, donations and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Commentary Magazine publishes original news and opinion pieces that favor neoconservative’s and are typically pro-Israel. They also produce several Podcasts per week.
Headlines often use moderate loaded emotional language to sway the reader such as this: Let the Impeachment Turf War Begin. This story is credibly sourced to the Washington Post. Although this is a conservative leaning publication they do not always align with the Trump administration: Trump Did This to Himself. When it comes to science, Commentary does not outright reject the  human impact on climate change, however they do not support government solutions and sometimes use wording that misleads on the impact such as this: The Worst Climate Change Canard.
In general, Commentary Magazine is very well written, with almost all stories favoring the right, however they do generally oppose the Trump Administration’s brand of Conservatism and usually properly source their information. 
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Commentary Magazine Right Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that favor the traditional Republican Party. We also rate them Mostly Factual for reporting, rather than High, due to sometimes misrepresenting the consensus of science on climate change, despite proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.

Common Dreams is 501(c)3 nonprofit that receives funding from donations. They also state they do not receive “corporate underwriting or government funding.”
Analysis / Bias 
In review, Common Dreams primarily covers political news with a left leaning bias in story selection and wording such as this: ‘Stop With This Recklessness’: Allies Warn Right-Wing Attacks Could Get Congresswoman Ilhan Omar Killed. This story is appropriately sourced to mostly left leaning media such as Splinter, NBC News and Vox. In general, news reporting favors the left through story selection and use of emotional wording. Editorially, Common Dreams features left leaning writers such as Glenn Greenwald, Ralph Nader, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Paul Krugman. Needless to say, op-eds strongly favor the left. Many op-eds are opposed to militarism and promote the need for action on climate change.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check by an IFCN fact checker.

History
Founded in 1985 by conservative thinker Irving Kristol, The National Interest (TNI) is an American bi-monthly international affairs magazine published by the Center for the National Interest, which we have rated as right-center biased. It is associated with the realist school of foreign policy thought, which contradicts the liberal thought of cooperation. The current executive editor is Harry Kazianis. In general, this is a foreign policy magazine that also touches on politics and other current events of our time. You can view their Masthead here.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The National Interest is owned by the Center for the National Interest, which is a right leaning think tank created by President Richard Nixon in 1994. The magazine is funded through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The National Interest primarily covers international affairs. Headlines typically utilize minimally loaded words such as these: Can Moon Jae-In Bridge the Gap between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un? and Brexit Will Heighten Division Within the European Union. These two articles are properly sourced to credible outlets such as Politico and The Conversation. Articles published are generally pro-military in that they believe aggressive actions are unwarranted as is passive actions that lead to vulnerability, but the theme is the USA comes first despite the action taken. In general, The National Interest is a factual source that leans right only because they tend to reject liberal ideology when it comes to foreign affairs.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

The website is owned by John Amato and is funded through online advertising and reader donations. Crooks and Liars also collaborates with the liberal Blue America PAC.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Crooks and Liars typically publishes information favorable to the left, while denigrating the right. Headlines are usually loaded with sensational wording such as this: Fox News Host Laura Ingraham Made A Fool Of Herself Trying To Pwn The Libs. This story is sourced to video followed by opinion commentary from the author. In another loaded headline, they report negatively on President Trump with this: GOP Cancels Four Primaries; Is Trump That Weak? This story is sourced to MSNBC video, Politico and tweets. 
The website also has as section called CLTV, which publishes video clips from other sources such as MSNBC and Fox News. Regardless of which source is used, the video almost always portrays the right negatively. In the MediaBites section they typically publish a video clip from the above mentioned sources and provide a written transcript below.
When it comes to science, Crooks and Liars supports the consensus of science regarding climate change and vaccines. However, when reporting on GMO’s most articles report negatively. In general, news reporting is rooted in fact, though the use of strongly loaded language can be misleading and potentially sway the reader.

Overall, we rate Crooks and Liars strongly Left Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that almost always favor Liberal causes. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting due to reasonable sourcing and fact check record. However, due to the use of sensational headlines and loaded wording, as well as not strictly adhering to the consensus of science with GMO’s, we cannot rate them High for factual reporting.

Analysis / Bias
In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked Argentina 57th out of 180 in their Press Freedom Index, and stated: “Media outlets regarded as overly critical are often the targets of defamation suits that usually end with damages awards designed to strangle them financially.” 
As of 2019, The president of Argentina is Alberto Fernandez, who according to CBS leans center-left. Further, according to Euronews, Alberto Fernandez is Peronist, which is neither left nor right, but rather a populist and nationalist movement based on the ideas and legacy of Argentine president Juan Perón.
In review, Infobae publishes articles with moderate emotionally loaded language such as these: “The details of the controversial decree that allows importing garbage from other countries” and “The president said there was no increase in the tax applied to the rural sector. “We are leaving standing what (Mauricio) Macri put in.” They also publish fact checks regarding the new president’s claims: “The truth about Alberto Fernández’s diagnosis” as well as critical articles about the outgoing president such as this: “How many of the main campaign promises Macri fulfilled during his tenure”. When it comes to sourcing, Infobae has a content alliance with the left-leaning Vice.com and the Washington Post. Further, Infobae often hyperlinks to itself as well as to credible sources such as AFP, and The New York Times.  When covering world news, pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a favorable tone such as in this article “In the middle of the process of political trial, Donald Trump reached his maximum popularity in the polls”.
In general, Infobae reports news factually as evidenced by a clean fact check record.

Encyclopedia Britannica describes them as “one of the most prestigious periodicals of its kind in the world.” Many articles are long form analysis with minimal use of loaded language such as this: What a War With Iran Would Look Like. This story is properly sourced to credible outlets such as the BBC and Military Times.

History
Founded in 1942, Voice of America (VOA) is a United States government-funded multimedia news source and the official external broadcasting institution of the United States. VOA provides programming for broadcast on radio, TV, and the Internet outside of the U.S., in English and some foreign languages. Some consider Voice of America to be a form of pro-USA propaganda. However, VOA journalists are governed by its Best Practices Guide which says that “The accuracy, quality and credibility of the Voice of America are its most important assets, and they rest on the audiences’ perception of VOA as an objective and reliable source of U.S., regional and world news and information.” Surveys show that 84% of VOA’s audiences say they trust VOA to provide accurate and reliable information, and a similar percentage (84%) say that VOA helps them understand current events relevant to their lives. VOA is produced in 40 languages.
Funded by / Ownership
VOA is owned by The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), formerly the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), which is an independent agency of the United States government. Voice of America is tax payer funded through the United States government.
Analysis / Bias
In review, VOA presents USA and world news from a United States perspective. There is minimal use of loaded language in news stories such as this: Officials Hope for Strife-Free Trump Visit to London and this Pompeo Seeks Common Ground on Iran, Huawei in Europe. Both of these stories are sourced to official video or credible sources. Some stories tend to lean slightly left through portraying President Trump negatively, such as this: Trump Unleashes Again on Special Counsel Who Didn’t Charge Him. When it comes to science the VOA follows the consensus model and therefore is pro-science. 
Voice of America has been called a propaganda arm of the US Government and perhaps it was at the start. Today, it is a straightforward journalism outfit that might lean slightly left, but is mostly least biased on a whole
A factual search reveals Voice of America has not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Voice of America Least Biased based on balanced story selection and minimal use of loaded words. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (8/15/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/1/2019)

Analysis / Bias
In review, local new is covered by journalist with minimal bias such as this: Two Cincinnati Police vice unit officers under federal investigation, prosecutor confirms. National news is covered with a link to USA Today. Editorially, the Cincinnati Enquirier endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for President, though in the past they have endorsed a balanced mix of left and right candidates. In general, the opinion page leans left with more stories favoring the left, but still balanced. 
In general, straight news is low biased and editorially there is a slight lean left.
A factual search reveals the Cincinnati Enquirer has not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the Cincinnati Enquirer Least Biased based on neutral news reporting and a minimal left lean editorially. We also rate them high for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (7/12/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 12/22/2018)

Expressen is owned by Global media company Bonnier Group, which is controlled by the Bonnier family. Carl-Johan Bonnier is the Chairman. Expressen generates revenue through commercial advertising and subscription fees. 
Analysis / Bias
Currently, Stefan Löfven is the Prime Minister of Sweden, he is also the leader of the Center-Left Social Democratic Party.

On its about page, Expressen states its editorial position as “The political orientation of the editorial page is liberal.” However, Liberals are considered center-right in Sweden.
In review, Expressen’s front page features video clips as well as articles in a tabloid format. Articles are published with bold over-sized text, big headlines and large photos. Expressen frequently publishes articles with loaded emotional language in their headlines such as in this article where they are critical of the former President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker: “Europe must have a leader who does not give up” and they are critical of the left leaning Prime Minister, “This is not enough for a prime minister.” This story also illustrates a strong right wing bias by characterizing immigrants negatively.
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a critical tone such as in this article, “Trump is a sociopath – the world’s most dangerous man.” Expressen typically utilizes credible sources such as Salon. Expressen also reports health and medical news such as this: “New hormonal drug for women increases sex drive.”
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

IAC (InterActiveCorp) is a media and Internet company comprised of some of the world’s well known brands such as HomeAdvisor, Vimeo, About.com, Dictionary.com, Investopedia and more. The Daily Beast is primarily funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
According to a Washington Post article, Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman describes how he will improve the Daily Beast. He states “I want us to lean harder into who we are”, explaining further “That means that if the Daily Beast is in the business of scoops — more scoops. “If we’re painting in bright colors now, I want to paint even brighter.”
In review, the Daily Beast tends to publish left leaning stories utilizing sensationalized headlines with emotionally loaded words such as “No, Rudy: Trump Isn’t Othello. He’s Iago” and “Imagine a Trump Who Could Constrain Himself and Just Talk About the Economy.” However, they do typically source the info in their reports by using credible sources such as Reuters, PBS, Slate, NY Times as well as sourcing themselves. 
A factual search reveals that the Daily Beast has failed a fact check, however when brought to their attention, they issued a correction to the story. They have also failed a second fact check that was not corrected.

History 
Kutv.com is a CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Broadcasting since 1954, KUTV particularly focuses on news pertaining to Utah. KUTV delivers local news, breaking news, weather, and sports.
Funded by / Ownership
KUTV is owned by the Sinclair Broadcasting Group. Sinclair owns numerous right leaning TV stations throughout the USA. They are funded through an advertising and subscription model.
Analysis / Bias
In review, KUTV republishes articles from credible sources such as the AP and utilizes sources such as http://blog.udot.utah.gov, and utahpolicy.com. In reporting, KUTV sometimes utilizes emotional language in their headlines such as “Utah doctor’s response to Trump tweet on climate change goes viral” and “New poll shows Romney with huge lead in Utah Senate race”. According to a Salt Lake Tribune article titled “Statement mandated by KUTV’s right-wing owner only highlights its hypocrisy”, KUTV is running a statement about fake news, which is mandated by the right leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group who owns the station.
Overall, KUTV articles are typically well sourced, therefore we rate them high for factual reporting and right-center biased due to ownership. (M. Huitsing 4/2/2018) Updated (9/7/2018)

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Christian Post covers news via reporters on topics of interest to Christians. Headlines are a mix of minimally loaded language with news headlines and some with strong emotionally loaded words on opinion pieces such as this: Beto O’Rourke, climate change, and the end of the world. This misleading headline implies that Beto O’Rourke is claiming the end of the world due to climate change. The content of the article does not reflect this. Rather it quotes O’Rourke, who said we have 12 years to take serious action on climate change based on scientific consensus. O’Rourke never mentions the end of the world. However, the author does, by quoting the Book of Revelations. This article also sources the factually mixed Daily Wire, which has failed fact checks by IFCN fact checkers. In general, most opinion pieces lean right, but not too far right to be considered extreme. 
When reporting straight news there is a strong Christian bias in story selection, but information is generally sourced properly to credible media outlets and organizations. 
A factual search reveals that The Christian Post has failed a fact check by IFCN fact checkers.

Funded by / Ownership
Townhall is owned by Salem Communications, which owns numerous right leaning Christian based radio stations across the USA. According to Open Secrets Salem Media Group donates 100% to Republicans and right leaning PACS. The website is funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Townhall almost exclusively publishes news articles that favors conservatives and utilizes strongly loaded language such as this: Shove It, House Democrats: Another Trump-Russia Story Blows Up. This story is sourced to the left leaning Axios and right leaning Fox News. In another article with loaded language, by Rush Limbaugh’s brother David: Abortion Extremism Exposing Left’s Moral Contradictions, there is not a single source listed to support Mr. Limbaugh’s claims. 
In general, Townhall presents story selection that almost always favors the right and uses negative wording to describe the left. There is little balance in story presentation with all information favoring the right without presenting a left perspective or counter argument. The opinion columnists associated with Townhall have poor fact check records such as Michelle Malkin, Ann Coulter and Ben Shapiro. Straight news reporting is generally sourced properly and factual, though worded to favor the right.

Above the Law is owned by Breaking Media, which owns six other websites. Revenue is derived through advertising, website servicing and marketing.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Above the Law primary publishes news and information that is geared toward law professionals. For example, they give career advice as well as firm salaries and rankings. Essentially, this is considered an insider publication for attorneys.  Most stories do not contain loaded emotional language such as this AI in healthcare has spurred exciting applications and collaboration. This story is properly sourced. 
Editorially, Above the Law does not have a favorable opinion of President Trump with stories such as this: International Law Expert Thinks Donald Trump Might Not Understand How Any Of This Works. While ATL is not overtly left biased by any means, they certainly do not favor the current administration. In general, the information on this website is factual with a left leaning bias in story selection.

History
Founded in 1976, In These Times is an American politically progressive monthly magazine of news and opinion published in Chicago, Illinois. According to their about page, they are “an independent, nonprofit magazine, is dedicated to advancing democracy and economic justice, informing movements for a more humane world, and providing an accessible forum for debate about the policies that shape our future.”
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
In These Times is a nonprofit that is owned and published by the Institute for Public Affairs (U.S.). Revenue is derived through advertising and donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, In These Times publishes news and opinion articles from a Democratic Socialist perspective. There is the frequent use of emotionally loaded language that favors the left such as this: To Save Species from Extinction, We Must Consider More than Just Numbers. Although biased in wording this story is properly sourced to scientific studies as well as The Conversation. Story selection always favors the progressive left and often denigrates the right and establishment Democrats such as this: Joe Biden Lied His Face Off About the Iraq War. 
Editorially, In These Times always favors the progressive left and denigrates corporations and those who support them. They often report favorably on Democratic Socialist candidates such as Bernie Sanders as evidenced by this: Want More Proof of Corporate Media’s Anti-Bernie Bias? Look at MSNBC’s Democratic Debate. In general, In These Times aligns with what would be considered the far left today: Pro-Environment, Pro-Choice, Pro-Feminism, Anti-Capitalism, Anti-Militarism, and Pro-Civil Rights. While these may not seem like extreme issues, in our current political climate they are considered on the far end of left. In general, In These Times sources information correctly and is factual, while holding a far-left editorial bias.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate In These Times far-Left Biased based on editorial positions that align with Democratic Socialism. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting, rather than High, due to a significant imbalance in story selection, as well as the use of frequent emotional language which can be misleading. (D.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Big Think publishes interviews, videos and news that utilizes minimally loaded words such as this, U.S. birthrate hits 32-year low. Here’s why that’s not (yet) a problem. This story is appropriately sourced to credible outlets. In fact, all stories are credibly sourced and science based. Editorially, there is minimal bias as evidenced by these mixed articles related to Donald Trump. 
When reviewing this site I was torn between placing this source in Pro-Science or Least Biased, but because they do some fact checks and also touch on some political issues I felt Least Biased is more appropriate. Everything here is sourced and delivered by experts in the given fields.

It had also been a finalist in six other Pulitzer awards in the 22-year period up until its sale in 2006, a record that was unsurpassed by any mid-sized newspaper in the United States during the same time frame. The Lexington Herald Leader reports accurately and is well sourced. They have a left-center editorial bias and endorse Democratic candidates. (D. Van Zandt 3/17/2017)

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: MIXED
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 2009, TheWrap is a Hollywood news and media site focusing on the business of entertainment and media. TheWrap was founded by Sharon Waxman, former Hollywood correspondent for the The New York Times and was backed by Maveron, a venture capital firm co-founded by Starbucks CEO, Howard Schultz. The Wrap focuses on investigative reporting, columns, criticism and feature writing. According to their about page description:
“The Wrap News Inc. is comprised of the award-winning, industry-leading website with its high-profile newsbreaks, investigative stories and authoritative analysis.”
Funded by / Ownership
TheWrap is owned by The Wrap News Inc. and revenue is derived from advertising.
Analysis / Bias 
In review, TheWrap reports news/commentary utilizing sources like Weekly Standard and Daily Beast as well as factually Questionable sources such as Breitbart. They use sensational emotional wording in their headlines and articles, however they usaully cover both sides such as: ” Ann Coulter Says She’s Out of Patience With ‘Emperor God’ Trump”,  “Young Turks’ Founder Cenk Uygur Apologizes for ‘Ugly,’ ‘Insensitive’ Old Blog Posts (Exclusive)” and “Trump Attacks CNN; CNN Tells Him How to Do His Job”.
TheWrap is difficult to classify. The individual articles on their website are biased toward both the left and right. However, there is frequent criticism of President Trump such as this: Trump Roasted for Misspelling First Lady’s Name in Tweet: ‘Who the F— Is Melanie?’.
In general, they always source their information, but sometimes those sources are of poor quality. The bottom line, is TheWrap’s sole purpose is to sell ads by getting as many page views as possible. They accomplish this by promoting sensational stories with little regard to political bias.
A factual search reveals they have an Unproven and False claim.
Overall, we rate TheWrap Left-Center biased due to editorial positions that moderately favor the left. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to occasional use of poor sources, sensationalism and a failed fact check. (M. Huitsing 12/28/2017) Updated (7/27/2019)

History
Founded in 1989, the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) is one of the country’s oldest and largest nonpartisan, nonprofit investigative news organizations with a mission “to serve democracy by revealing abuses of power, corruption and betrayal of public trust by powerful public and private institutions, using the tools of investigative journalism.” With over 50 staff members, the CPI is one of the largest nonprofit investigative centers in America.  The Center releases its reports via its website to media outlets throughout the U.S. and around the globe. They won the Pulitzer Prize in 2014.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The Center for Public Integrity is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is funded through donations and grants from foundations such as the Carnegie Corporation, Leonardo Di Caprio Foundation and the Knight Foundation. CPI discloses their largest donors here.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Center for Public Integrity publishes in-depth journalistic research into corruption involving social and political issues. Topics tend to lean left with a focus on campaign finance, support for immigration and workers rights. The website reports news with moderate to minimal loaded language such as this: A PATCHWORK OF ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS DON’T PROTECT LGBTQ WORKERS. This story is appropriately sourced to Supreme Court documents and Politico. When it comes to reporting on the current administration, they have a negative tone regarding the Trump administration as evidenced by this: NUMBER OF ICE DETAINEES WITH NO CRIMINAL RECORD RISES SHARPLY, DEFYING TRUMP RHETORIC. This story is also perfectly sourced. 
Editorially, the CPI favors liberal policies and denigrates the conservative agenda. For example, the left leaning Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting has described CPI as “progressive”, as has the LA Times who have described them as “Liberal”.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the Center for Public Integrity (CPI) Left-Center Biased based on story selection and advocacy that favors mostly liberal positions. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 7/6/2016) Updated (10/18/2019)

Funded by / Ownership
Heavy is owned by Heavy Inc. and was originally funded with 32.8 million dollars by Polaris Partners. Currently, revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Heavy does not perform original reporting of news, but rather is known for their fast five facts, where they take a story from a credible news outlet and bullet point five facts about the story. Topics range from entertainment to breaking news and politics. Heavy uses mild to moderate loaded language in headlines such as this: How Much Will Trump’s Fourth of July Salute to America Cost? This story is properly sourced to the Washington Post, CNBC and USA Today. According to Slate, Heavy does not do original reporting, but the speed with which they can compile their fast facts is very quick. It has also been this reviewers observation that Heavy is often one of the first to breakdown a fast breaking story. When it comes to story selection Heavy is mostly balanced, but more stories would appeal to the left.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Heavy, slightly Left-Center biased based on story selection that sometimes favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (11/13/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 7/20/2019)

History
Founded in 2002, the Illinois Policy Institute is a nonprofit think tank. They describe themselves on their about page as: “an independent organization generating public policy solutions aimed at promoting personal freedom and prosperity in Illinois.” The Institute’s founder is Springfield native Greg Blankenship, who left the group in 2009. The Institute’s CEO and president is John Tillman and according to Rachel Wells from the Illinois Times, Tillman states their mission as “to advance free-market principles and policies so we look for data that supports that.” Tillman also attends Tea Party rallies promoting revolution. Illinois Policy Institute covers topics such as economics, education, politics and more.
Funded by / Ownership
The Illinois Policy Institute is a 501(c)(3) public charity with an associated lobbying unit called the Illinois Policy Action, a 501(c)(4). The Institute also has an affiliated public-interest law firm named the Liberty Justice Center. According to Sourcewatch, the Illinois Policy Institute receives funding from several donors connected to Koch Industries and those who promote fossil fuels.
In review, they typically use credible sources in their reporting, such as the Illinois General Assembly, Chicago Tribune, and Forbes. However, they are right biased through the political causes they support. For example, they are opposed to Obamacare and support to repeal it and through their position on public education. They also use emotional headlines such as “HUNDREDS ON MEDICAID WAITING LIST IN ILLINOIS DIE WHILE WAITING FOR CARE.”
A factual search reveals the Illinois Policy Institute has not failed a check by IFCN fact checkers.

Launched in 2007, Patch is a hyperlocal news and information site which was formerly part of AOL. It is an online news and information portal for 1200 neighborhood and community websites across the USA.  
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
Currently, Patch is owned by investment firm Hale Global. Warren St. John is the CEO. Revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Patch Media runs a large US based hyperlocal network of sites. Patch primarily covers tabloid style news and news that generates the most traffic, such as police and local sports with an emphasis on sensational headlines such as “What Could Cause A Superintendent To Poop On A Track?” Although headlines are somewhat sensational the content of articles uses a low biased neutral tone that does not favor the right or left.
In their national news reporting they utilize listicle style headlines such as “Stormy Daniels Payoff: 5 Things To Clear Your Confusion” and typically they source to credible sources such as the Washington Post, NBC News, citizensforethics.org, commoncause.org, Star-Ledger, and occasionally factually mixed sources such as CNN and Fox News. In addition, they republish stories from Associated Press.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: HIGH
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 45/180
History
Founded in 1909, The Las Vegas Review-Journal is a major daily newspaper published in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is the largest circulating daily newspaper in Nevada, and one of two daily newspapers in the Las Vegas area. In 2015, the newspaper was secretly bought by Sheldon Adelson through a company called News + Media Capital Group LLC. Sheldon Adelson is a billionaire known for donating large sums of money to Republicans, including Donald Trump. After Adelson purchased the paper there were editorial changes that led to many reporters and editors leaving the newspaper citing “curtailed editorial freedom, murky business dealings and unethical managers.” Longtime columnist John L. Smith resigned after he was told he could no longer write anything about Adelson, a frequent focus of his reporting. Within six months, all three of the reporters who broke the story of Adelson’s ownership had left the paper.
Funded by / Ownership
The Las Vegas Review-Journal is owned by Sheldon Adelson through News + Media Capital Group LLC. The newspaper is funded through subscriptions and advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports local news through the use of journalists and uses minimally loaded words in headlines and articles. National/International news is delivered via the Associated Press. All news stories are properly sourced and credited to credible information. Editorially, there is a right leaning bias that reflects the conservative positions of ownership. For example, the Las Vegas Review-Journal was one of the first newspapers in the country to endorse Donald Trump for President. A review of their opinion page shows more articles favoring the right. When it comes to story selection there is right leaning bias and as mentioned above the paper censors negative news stories regarding Sheldon Adelson.
A factual search reveals the Las Vegas Review-Journal has not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the Las Vegas Review-Journal Right-Center biased based on editorial positions and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information. (7/14/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 11/9/2018)

There is little bias exhibited as they tend to only publish pro-science information. In general, this is a popular science site that summarizes reports in one paragraph and then links to the full article. They never skew data and summarize properly, based on our numerous reviews.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Science Daily a Pro-Science Source based on proper scientific sourcing and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 8/20/2016) Updated (4/19/2019)

History
Founded in 2007 by the Tampa Bay Times, PolitiFact.com utilizes reporters and editors from the Times and affiliated media outlets to “fact-check statements by members of Congress, the White House, lobbyists and interest groups”.  They publish original statements and their evaluations on the PolitiFact.com website, and assign each a “Truth-O-Meter” rating. The ratings range from “True” for completely accurate statements to “Pants on Fire” (from the taunt “Liar, liar, pants on fire”) for false and ridiculous claims. In 2018, Politifact became affiliated with the Poynter Institute.

According to their about page “In 2018, PolitiFact was acquired by the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit school for journalists. While PolitiFact relies on administrative support from the Poynter Institute, it is otherwise financially self-sustaining. PolitiFact receives support from online advertising, as well as revenue generated through content partnerships and from grants.”
Analysis / Bias
In review, Politifact has been called left biased by some right leaning sources. In fact, there is a source called Politifact Bias that is dedicated to pointing out Politifact’s biases. Politifact is also a signatory of the International Fact Checking Network (IFCN), which outlines a code principles for credible fact checkers.
Politifact uses minimal loaded language in their articles and headlines such as this: Trump falsely claims NATO countries owe United States money for defense spending. All information is well sourced to credible media and/or direct statements from experts in the field or the politicians themselves. Fact Check selection leans slightly left as more right wing politicians are currently fact checked. This may be due to bias or the fact that Republicans currently control all branches of government and hence there is more to check. In fact, there was a recent academic study done that shows Politifact employs minimal bias through wording.
Overall, this update reveals a slight leftward shift in Politifact’s fact checking selection, but not enough to move them from the least biased category. (7/10/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt (2/05/2020)

In review, La Stampa utilizes minimally loaded emotional wording in headlines that favor Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (Center-Left) and critical of Far right populist Lega (League) leader Matteo Salvini: “The fate of the Conte government lies in the hands of the Consulta”.  This article, “Salvini wants to lead Italy. He may be about to get the chance”. is written by Maurizio Molinari who is the editor-in-chief of La Stampa,   They are also critical of coalition partner, the populist 5 Star Movement.

Funded by / Ownership
Truthdig is held through Truthdig LLC and generates revenue through advertising, donations and grants, which are not disclosed on the website.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Truthdig states openly in their mission statement that they are progressive: “The website’s mission is to dig beneath the headlines, provide expert reporting and commentary from a progressive point of view and offer an outlet for original work by exceptional journalists.” Truthdig writes original content that uses moderately loaded language such as this: The Real Russian Menace Is Just Hypercapitalism. This story is properly sourced to the Washington Post and Forbes and clearly labels it as an opinion piece. In another story with loaded language The GOP’s White Supremacy Now Has a Smoking Gun, there is again proper labeling as an opinion piece and proper sourcing to The Hill and Pew Research. Straight news mostly comes from other sources such as the Associated Press, Propublica and the Independent Media Institute. News is broken down into categories such as LGBTQ, environment, immigration and activism to name a few. In general, straight news favors the left and editorially there is a strong left leaning bias through the issues they advocate. 
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Truthdig Left Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to excellent sourcing and a clean fact check record. (11/18/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 6/8/2019)

History
The Albuquerque Journal traces its history to 1880. It is the successor to a newspaper called the Golden Gate, which was established in June of that year. In the fall of 1880, the owner of the Golden Gate died and Journal Publishing Company was founded. The daily paper name was changed to the Albuquerque Journal in 1925 when an independent editorial policy was established. The current editor is Karen Moses.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The Albuquerque Journal is owned by the Journal Publishing Company, which is in turn owned by William P. Lang. The newspaper generates revenue through advertising and subscription fees.
In review, the Albuquerque Journal reports local news through journalists with the use of minimally loaded headlines such as this: NM oil production hit record high in 2018. Information in articles is typically well sourced. National News comes from the Associated Press. Editorially, the topic selection is mostly balanced with slightly more leaning right. Further, the Albuquerque Journal has a long history of endorsing Republican candidates. For example, the editorial board of the Albuquerque Journal “endorsed Republican presidential candidates including former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in 2012, U.S. Sen. John McCain in 2008 and President George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004.”
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
In March 2020, Berkshire Hathaway sold the Richmond Times-Dispatch to Lee Enterprises, which according to Open Secrets has donated 88% of its money to Republican politicians since 1990. The paper and website are funded through advertising and subscriptions.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Richmond Times-Dispatch covers local news through reporters with minimal bias such as this: Northam outlines phase one of Virginia’s plan for emerging from COVID-19 pandemic. National and international news is republished through the Associated Press.
Editorially, The Richmond Times has supported Republican Presidential candidates since 1980, with the exception of 2016 when they supported the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. In other words, they have not supported a Democrat in at least 40 years. In general, the news is reported factually with a right-leaning editorial bias.

Funded by / Ownership
Truthout is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is funded through donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Truthout is a progressive news and opinion website that is focused on social justice and the environment. There is significant use of loaded emotional language that favors the left such as this: Scapegoating Unions for the Postal Service’s Phony Crisis. This op-ed is properly sourced to credible outlets such as Brookings and whitehouse.gov. Straight news reporting comes from both Truthout staff, as well as republishing from other sources. Most of the sources used for republishing are left leaning such as Common Dreams, Salon and Rewire. In general, story selection always favors the left with negative reporting on President Trump such as this: Donald Trump’s Only Strategy Is to Create Crisis and Claim to Fix It.
When it comes to science Truthout holds a negative view toward GMO’s and uses highly sensationalized and conspiratorial headlines such as this: Have Monsanto and the Biotech Industry Turned Natural Pesticides Into GMO “Super Toxins”?
Although Truthout has not failed a fact check by an IFCN fact checker, they have reported some stories that were not factual.  For example, a reporter claimed that Karl Rove was indicted on charges when in fact he wasn’t.  The reporter continued to make the claim without evidence.  See link here. Although this is only one example, it shows that this source should be checked when in doubt.
Overall, we rate Truthout strongly Left Biased based on story selection and political positions that favor the left. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to publishing a false story as well as promoting anti-GMO propaganda. (5/15/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 4/07/2019)

Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
Esquire is owned by Hearst Communications, which owns more than 300 media outlets across the United States, including the San Francisco Chronicle, the Houston Chronicle, and Cosmopolitan. Esquire generates revenue through subscriptions, display ads, sponsored content and the sale of products from affiliate marketers.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Esquire publishes information and stories geared toward men. Content is written by staff and some stories are derived from other Hearst properties. When reporting political news, Esquire uses strong loaded language that usually favors the left such as this: The Koch Money Was a Primary Vector for the Prion Disease That’s Infected the Republican Party. This story is properly sourced to the New York Times and New Yorker. Editorially, Esquire does not separate commentary articles from general news, however, virtually all reporting on President Trump and his administration is negative. For example these:
The G7 Is Just Another Stage for a Presidential Sh*tshow
Trump Emboldens Racist Terrorists. Then He Plays Sheriff on Twitter.
Jeffrey Epstein, Donald Trump, and a Russian Oligarch Is Peak Sleazy Corruption
A factual search reveals Esquire has failed one fact check.
CNN accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography in Boston on Thanksgiving night. – FALSE
Overall, we rate Esquire Left Biased based on story selection and editorials that favor the left and denigrate the right. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting due to one failed fact check as well as hyper-partisan wording that can be misleading. (D. Van Zandt 11/3/2016) Updated (8/26/2019)

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: MOSTLY FACTUAL
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 2008, Ammoland is a pro-gun/2nd amendment website that claims to be “the web’s leading Shooting Sports News Service for the Ammunition, Firearms, Shooting, Hunting and Conservation communities. The current Editor-in-Chief is Fredy Riehl and the website lists all authors.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The website is owned by Ammoland Inc, based in Sebastian, Florida. It is not clear who owns Ammoland Inc. Revenue is derived by primarily advertising guns and gun related products.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Ammoland typically only reports on the gun industry, guns sports and 2nd Amendment issue. When reporting on non-political issues, Ammoland uses a neutral tone, however when reporting on politics there is strong use of loaded emotional language that favors the right, such as this: March For Our Lives Has A Peace Plan, And It’s A Horror for America. This story is properly sourced to the BBC, Our World in Data and Australian Government statistics. In an op-ed How Can The Left & Right Agree On Guns? Don’t Even Try! They Can’t! there is significant use of loaded emotional language that denigrates the left by routinely calling liberals “Radical Leftists.” This op-ed also does not hyperlink to a single source. In another article, Every Mass Shooting Shares One Thing In Common & It’s NOT Weapons they promote a conspiracy theory that claims that gun manufacturer John Noveske died under suspicious circumstances for exposing the link between prescription drugs and mass-casualty shootings. This has never been substantiated. In general, when reporting on guns and sport, Ammoland is low biased and factually sourced, however when reporting on political issues there is a very strong right leaning bias that is mostly factual.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Ammoland Right Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that routinely favor the right. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting based on proper sourcing of non-political stories, however when reporting on political issues they have made an unsubstantiated claim. (D.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: HIGH
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 1974, People is an American weekly magazine of mostly celebrity and human-interest stories, published by the Meredith Corporation. With a readership of 46.6 million adults, People has the largest audience of any American magazine. The current editor is Dan Wakeford.
Funded by / Ownership
In 2017, People Magazine was bought by the Meredith Corporation from Time Inc. The Meredith Corporation “owns magazines, television stations, websites, and radio stations. Meredith’s publications have a readership of more than 120 million, paid circulation of more than 40 million, and its websites have nearly 135 million monthly unique visitors. Meredith’s broadcast television stations reach 11% of U.S. households.” Revenue is derived through advertising, subscriptions, and newsstand sales.
Analysis / Bias
In review, People Magazine primarily publishes general interest and celebrity news, however the online section contains a politics section that we will review. Political news sometimes uses emotionally loaded language that favors the left such as this: Trump Tried to Attack Biden Using a Nickelback Song, Then His Tweet Was Taken Down Over Copyright: ‘The Dumbest Timeline’. Other political stories are more serious and properly sourced such as this: Planned Parenthood to Open Large Clinic Near States Where Abortion Access Is Threatened. In general, the editorial direction of People is left biased with many stories negative toward conservatives and the Trump Administration.

History
Talking Points Memo (or TPM) is a liberal web-based political journalism website created and run by Josh Marshall, a journalist, liberal blogger and historian. It debuted on November 12, 2000. According to their about page “Talking Points Memo (commonly known as TPM) is one of the premier digital native political news organizations in the United States – covering a broad range of politics, policy and national news.”
In 2007, TPM won a Polk Award for its coverage of the 2006 U.S. Attorneys scandal, becoming the only blog so far to win the award. 
Funded by / Ownership
Talking Point Memo is published by TPM Media LLC. The company is headquartered in New York City and maintains a bureau in Washington, DC. Revenue is derived from advertising as well as a fee based subscription to reduce advertising and access to the Editor’s Blog.
Analysis / Bias
In review, TPM reports on breaking stories, investigative journalism and opinion pieces. Story selection usually favors the left and uses mild to moderate loaded language such as this: Trump Claims Doctors Left Operating Rooms To Greet Him In El Paso. Hospital Says Nope. This story is essentially a summary of a Think Progress article, however it is properly sourced and factual. In general, editorials and story selection always leans left and often is very critical of President Trump, such as this: Trump Doubles Down: American Jews Who Vote Dem Are ‘Disloyal’ To Israel. Again, this story is properly sourced to evidence via tweets, video and the Anti-Defamation League. Further, the website offers a blog written by Josh Marshall that does frequently utilize strong loaded language that again favors the left such as this: Today’s Agenda: NRA Appears To Quash Trump’s Feeble Gun Control Inclination.
In general, TPM reports news factually, albeit with a moderately strong liberal-progressive bias.
A factual search reveals they have failed one fact check.
Overall, we rate Talking Points Memo (TPM) Left Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that frequently favor the left. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting due to proper sourcing of information and one failed fact check. (7/26/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 8/23/2019)

History
The New Statesman is a British political and cultural magazine published in London. Founded as a weekly review of politics and literature on 12 April 1913, it was connected then with Sidney and Beatrice Webb and other leading members of the socialist Fabian Society. The magazine has, according to its present self-description holds a liberal, skeptical, political position.
Funded by / Ownership
New Statesman is owned by GlobalData PLC, which is a data analytics and media company that was established in 1999, and has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2000. It was previously called Progressive Digital Media and before that, the TMN Group. Revenue is generated through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The New Statesman reports news and opinions with a left leaning bias in story selection and wording such as this: It is getting harder and harder for Nancy Pelosi to resist calls to impeach Trump. This story, like most on the New Statesman utilizes credible sources such as Roll Call and the Washington Post. For the most part, stories are opposed to conservatives whether it be the US version of the New Statesman or the UK version such as this: Rory Stewart has said what many Conservative moderates are thinking about Boris Johnson. When it comes to UK politics, the New Statesman does not support Brexit and when it comes to US politics, they do not support President Trump. In general, most stories favor the left and denigrate the right.

Detailed Report

Country: France
World Press Freedom Rank: France 32/180
History
Euronews is a European multilingual news media service, headquartered in Lyon, France. Created in 1993, it aims to cover world news from a pan-European perspective. According to their about page they disclaim that they report from a pro-EU perspective “As a media with a strong European and multicultural DNA, Euronews is a widely recognized and trusted brand.”
Funded by / Ownership
Euronews is jointly owned by several European and North African state broadcasting organizations, and since 2015 majority-owned (53%) by Media Globe Networks led by Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris who is chairman of the supervisory board. NBC Universal also holds a 25% stake. Revenue is derived from advertising and subscription fees. Euronews also receives 24.5 million dollars in subsidies from the European Union.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Euronews publishes European and International news often paring text and video from the TV station. News stories use minimal loaded biased language such as this: Drone attacks cause fires and explosions at Saudi oil refineries. This story is appropriately sourced through video, tweets and Reuters. The website also publishes news from AFP, AP and NBC News.
In general, news reporting is neutral and factual, while editorial content has a leftward tilt. For example, in this article they support workers rights, Policymakers should better protect outdoor workers from the sun and in this article they accept the consensus on climate change and advocate for the worker, Climate-friendly policies can succeed in Europe – but not at the expense of workers. When it comes to Brexit, Euronews typically reports negatively. Further, op-eds typically report negatively on USA President Donald Trump as well, such as this: Twitter diplomacy: The “Money Heist” of Trump’s Foreign Policy.
Euronews has been accused of Anti-Russia bias by the Questionable RT News. They have also been accused of significant pro-EU bias.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Euronews Least Biased based on well sourced neutral news reporting. Although there is a slight to moderate left lean in editorial content, it represents a small portion of the website, therefore we place them at the farthest left point of Least Biased. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 7/31/2016) Updated (9/14/2019)

Funded by / Ownership
The Greensboro News & Record is owned by (BH Media Group) Berkshire Hathaway which is run by billionaire Warren Buffett. BH Media group owns more than 30 daily newspapers. Revenue is derived through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Greensboro News & Record covers local news through journalists with minimal bias such as this: Man wanted in Nov. 11 robbery, vehicle chase in High Point arrested in Wilmington, police say. National and international news is derived from the Washington Post, Associated Press and other wire services. 
Editorially, the News & Record has endorsed Democratic presidential candidates since 1984, including Hillary Clinton in 2016. Editorial columns and op-eds also tend to slightly favor the left, though both voices are represented. In general, they report news factually with a slightly left leaning bias editorially.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check. 
Overall, we rate the Greensboro News & Record Left-Center biased based on editorial positions that slightly favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (5/16/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 12/06/2019)

History
Founded in 2008, Legal Insurrection is a conservative blog created by William A. Jacobson who is an American lawyer and professor. According to their about page “Legal Insurrection now is one of the most widely cited and influential conservative websites, with hundreds of thousands of visitors per month. Our work has been highlighted by top conservative radio personalities, such as Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin.”
Funded by / Ownership
On March 1, 2019, legalinsurrection.com became a platform for the Legal Insurrection Foundation, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. The website generates revenue through advertising and donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Legal Insurrection is a conservative blog that frequently uses loaded language in articles and headlines such as this: Pitting Americans against each other in the “Climate Change” debate. This story uses proper sources such as The Hill and New York Times as well as the factually mixed Fox News. Other articles are not favorable toward the left such as this: Croissant-gate: Ocasio-Cortez outraged by inhumane cost of capitalist croissants at LaGuardia Airport. This article is primarily soured to Twitter posts. The Legal Insurrection frequently reports on climate change, though they do not outright deny human influenced climate change, they do sow doubt and tend to favor free market solutions. In general, all stories favor the right and denigrate the left.

World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Campus Reform is a college news website. They claim to be “a conservative watchdog to the nation’s higher education system, Campus Reform exposes liberal bias and abuse on the nation’s college campuses.” The website is a project of the Leadership Institute, which is an institute founded in 1979 by conservative activist Morton C. Blackwell. Its mission is to “increase the number and effectiveness of conservative activists” and to “identify, train, recruit and place conservatives in politics, government, and media.”
The current editor-in-chief is Lawrence B. Jones III.

Funded by / Ownership
Campus Reform is owned by the Leadership Institute, which discloses their financial information, however they do not list donors. Some notable donors include: The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, Adolph Coors Foundation, Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation and DeVos Urban Leadership Initiative.  Revenue for Campus Reform is generated though donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the majority of articles are negative toward liberal activists on college campuses. There is use of some loaded words that typically favor the right such as this Conservatives claim victory after U Florida settles First Amendment case. Campus Reform typically sources their information, however they have been flagged for making an unproven claim. In reviewing the journalists involved in this project many have worked for the conservative and mixed factual Daily Caller, which has failed numerous fact checks as well as CNS News and The Blaze.
Editorially, all stories favor the right with many reporting favorably on President Donald Trump. When it comes to science, Campus Reform does not outright deny that Global Warming is related to fossil fuels, however, they frequently report negatively on Climate Change Activists.
Overall, we rate Campus Reform Right Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that routinely favor the Right. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to an unproven claim as well as affiliation with sources that have failed many fact checks. (D. Van Zandt 8/23/2017) Updated (9/16/2019)

History
Founded in 1998, The National Post is a Canadian English-language broadsheet newspaper. The paper is the flagship publication of Postmedia Network, and is published Tuesdays through Saturdays. The current editor is Anne Marie Owens.
Read our profile on Canadian government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The National Post is owned by PostMedia, which owns several right leaning media outlets throughout Canada. According to a report in the left leaning CanadaLand, PostMedia has directed its publications to be more “reliably conservative.” The newspaper is funded through advertising and subscription fees.
Chatham Asset Management, a New Jersey based hedge fund holds a large equity stake in Postmedia and majority ownership of American Media Inc. which owns the National Enquirer. David Pecker, who owns American Media, Inc. joined the Postmedia board, and then resigned from the board of Postmedia in 2018, due to his involvement of hush payments on behalf of his “friends” including President Trump and Harvey Weinstein.
According to the National Observer, PostMedia is in a downward spiral. After Postmedia announced a $1.4M loss for the last quarter of 2018, Paul Godfrey stepped down as CEO of the Postmedia Network and was replaced by Andrew MacLeod, as of 1/10/2019. Godfrey, will remain as executive chair. Godfrey was also criticized for cutting 800 full-time jobs across Postmedia in 2016, while earning an annual salary of $1.7 million. For a list of directors and upper management please see here.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The National Post publishes news about Canada and the World. Most Canadian news is from The Canadian Press and world news from the Associated Press. Toronto news comes from local journalists and politics comes from a variety of sources that lean right. Editorially, Post Media mostly supports the consensus of science with climate change, but does present doubts. In general, National Post has a slight right lean through support of President Trump.

LBC is owned by British Media Company Global Radio. Revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, LBC radio primarily broadcasts talk and phone-in type shows and has a number of right wing presenters such as Iain Dale, who ran as a conservative for parliament and Nick Ferrari who has been criticized by the broadcasting standards commission for encouraging racism against asylum seekers. They also had Katie Hopkins who is a conservative provocateur and had to resign over a controversial tweet. Her views are similar to American conservative political commentator, Ann Coulter. Recently, conservative Nigel Farage hosted a talk show on LBC. On the left they have James O’Brien who describes himself as a “champagne socialist”.
In 2009, radio host Jeni Barnett promoted anti-vaccination propaganda on the air and was harshly criticized by the scientific community.

In review, Salon focuses on U.S. politics and current affairs. Story selection almost always favors the left and there is frequent use of loaded emotional language such as this: What campus free speech? Arizona case shows how far the right will go to stifle dissent. This story, like most on Salon is properly sourced to credible media such as the New York Times, The Guardian and the Arizona Republic. Salon also publishes health and science news that is scientifically based. Editorially, Salon utilizes strong wording that is anti-right in tone such as this: Donald Trump is running for president as a flat-out racist. Further, they do not clearly label opinion pieces which can be misleading.
A factual search reveals that they have been a part of a failed a fact check, but not the primary source.
Overall, we rate Salon Left Biased based on story selection that strongly favors the left and endorsements of political positions that are affiliated with the Democratic Party. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information and adherence to the consensus of science. (D. Van Zandt 5/15/2016) Updated (4/7/2019)

In review, The News-Gazette uses credible sources in their reporting. For example, they often republish articles from the Associated Press, under their Nation/World News subcategory: “Trump to pitch tax plan as boon for truckers”. The News-Gazette, editorially endorsed neither Trump or Clinton: Nobody for president. However, the News-Gazette tends to slightly favor the right editorially.

It is fairly and accurately reported, containing remarks from both Republicans and Democrats regarding the lack of attacks. While the article has a very slight right bias, it is by a Washington DC reporter, Kery Murakari. a stringer for Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. (CNHI).

Brookings is the most frequently cited think tank by the U.S. media and politicians. The current President is John R. Allen.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
Brookings Institution is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that is funded through donations. Each year they provide a transparent annual report regarding finances and funding. According to Open Secrets, Brookings has donated 96% or $824,259 to Democratic candidates and causes since 1990.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The research agenda and recommendations of Brookings’ 300+ scholars represent diverse points of view. “Research topics cover foreign policy, economics, development, governance and metropolitan policy.”
An academic analysis of Congressional records from 1993 to 2002 found that Brookings was referred to by conservative politicians almost as frequently as liberal politicians, earning a score of 53 on a 1–100 scale with 100 representing the most liberal score. Further, Brookings has been accused of having a liberal bias and a conservative bias, however the consensus is they are centrist.
Brookings utilizes moderately loaded language in their headlines and articles such as this: Don’t ignore the national debt. It will only get worse if we don’t act now. This article is properly sourced and labeled appropriately as an Op-Ed. Brookings also publishes their research on the website: Empowering women entrepreneurs in developing countries. Their research is also deeply sourced to credible information and outlets. In general, the scope of stories and information on the Brookings website tends to slightly lean left politically.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Brooking Institution Left-Center biased based on donations to primarily Democratic candidates, as well as policy advocacy that slightly favors the left.

Notes: Oklahoma’s NewsChannel 4/ KFOR TV is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and broadcasting since 1949. KFOR TV particularly focuses on information in Oklahoma City, delivering local news, breaking news, weather, and sports. KFOR-TV is owned by Tribune Media and has recently been bought by Sinclair Broadcast Group (Pending).
KFOR TV and KFOR.com currently has a left-center bias in reporting coverage through their use of CNN Wire as their primary national and international news source. With local reporting they use minimal loaded words and also tend to source to other left-center sources such as the Southern Poverty Law Center. KFOR TV and KFOR.com is well sourced, therefore we rate them high for factual reporting with a left-center bias. (M. Huitsing 8/15/2017)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette reports local and regional news through journalists with minimal bias such as this: Toddler, woman, killed in crash on U.S. 67 near I-40 in North Little Rock, authorities say. National and international news is derived from the Associated Press.
Editorially, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette has traditionally endorsed Republican candidates, however in 2016 they refused to endorse Donald Trump or any candidate for that matter.

Funded by / Ownership
La Repubblica is owned by GEDI Gruppo Editoriale S.p.A. (La Stampa and 13 local newspapers), which is an Italian holding company owned by the De Benedetti family. However, recently La Repubblica was acquired by Exor (the holding company of the Agnelli family which also owns Italian car company Fiat). John Elkann is the Chairman of Exor and at the time of this analysis, the transition to new ownership is still ongoing. La Repubblica’s business model is based on subscriptions and advertising. For financial reports see here.
Analysis / Bias
La Repubblica is generally regarded as politically leaning left.
In review, La Reppublica uses loaded emotional wording in headlines that favor Prime Minister Conti (Center-Left ) “Prime Minister Conte arrives: on the eve of the visit to sick children and workers.” They also publish local news such as “Burst of thefts at home in Parma and in the province: two police arrests”, and science news regarding developments about space and the environment.  Further, they conduct their own interviews such as here. For the most part they utilize credible sources such as Nasa.gov, The European Space Agency (esa.int.) and Reuters videos.

La Repubblica also owns online TV “RepTV” with themes such as “Cat stuck 20 meters high on the ring road barrier: the rescue”. When covering foreign politics pertaining to USA they typically are neutral and fact based such as this: “The Chamber votes yes to impeachment. Trump: “An assault on America and the Republicans.” 
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate La Repubblica Left-Center biased based on story selection and editorial positions that moderately favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (M. Huitsing 12/28/2019)

Analysis / Bias
In review, Buffalo News reports local news of the Niagara Falls – Buffalo metro area through staff reporters with minimal bias in wording such as this Tonawanda man charged in Texas de Brazil Galleria shooting, prosecutors say. The newspaper and website does not really cover national and international news, but rather focuses on New York State.
Editorially, Buffalo News covers both sides with little difference in coverage. However, they have endorsed Democratic candidates in the past such as President Obama in 2012 and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. In general, Buffalo News reports news factually and with a left leaning editorial bias.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

The Boston Herald is a tabloid newspaper that reports local news through the use of journalists. National news is syndicated via the Associated Press. The Boston Herald uses minimal loaded words in their news reporting and properly sources there information. Editorially, they presents both sides, however, there is more right leaning opinions expressed. During the 2016 Presidential Election the Boston Herald did not endorse a candidate, however they have a long history of endorsing Republican candidates.

The website offers original reporting in a straightforward manner such as this: Admitted Russian Agent Butina Freed From U.S. Prison Ahead of Expected Deportation. This story is properly sourced to CNN. Another example of a low biased story can be found here: Russia’s Central Bank Cuts Interest Rates on Economic Fears. When it comes to reporting on USA news the Moscow Times has a negative opinion of Donald Trump and his relationship with Putin such as this: Trump Isn’t Putin’s Puppet. He’s Just Unfit for Office.","Overall, we rate the Moscow Times Left-Center Biased based on editorial bias that generally favors the left and rejects the authoritarian right. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record.","These media sources have a slight to moderate liberal bias.  They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor liberal causes.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: VERY HIGH
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 1955, Roll Call is a newspaper and website published in Washington, D.C., when the United States Congress is in session, reporting news of legislative and political maneuverings on Capitol Hill, as well as political coverage of congressional elections across the country. According to their about page “As the leading provider of congressional news, legislative tracking and advocacy services, CQ Roll Call is the only media company that connects policy professionals and opinion leaders with the information and tools they need to understand and influence Congress.”
In 2009, Roll Call merged with CQ (Congressional Quarterly) and became known as CQ Roll Call.
The current editor is Ed Timms.
Funded by / Ownership
In 2018, Roll Call was purchased by FiscalNote, a privately held software, data, and media company headquartered in Washington, D.C. Revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
Roll Call is a solid “just the facts” news source, featuring a writing staff with an impressive set of credentials in political journalism. The articles are well sourced, and the information is presented “as is” with very minimal bias such as this Trump to skip Poland trip, and monitor Hurricane Dorian as it heads toward Florida. While looking through the articles one in particular caught my attention. The article addressed the much hyped, on both sides, possibility of using National Guard troops to assist ICE in finding and deporting illegal immigrants. There is no real substance to the claim at this point, which came from an early draft of a “what if” style memo that never reached any official level.  I’ve read numerous articles on the issue, and Roll Call’s article was the fairest and least biased I have seen.
The only “negative” I found was in the editorial content. For a site that is so balanced in other areas, the editorials do reveal a slight left bias. While I understand that op-ed pages are just that, opinions, I wouldn’t mind seeing some opposing views as well. Still, if you just stick with the articles, I have to say that Roll Call is the best site I’ve found in quite some time for fair, factual, and informative journalism.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Roll Call Least Biased based on straightforward, factually based news reporting. We also rate them Very-High for factual reporting due to strong sourcing and a clean fact check record. (D. Kelley 2/18/2017) Updated (8/30/2019)

However, it has since dropped out of the top 10. It was founded in 1919, and was the first U.S. daily printed in tabloid format. The editor was Jim Rich until July 23, 2018, when it was  announced he was being let go along with 50% of the editorial staff. The owner of the paper, Tronc, replaced Jim Rich with Robert York, who is currently the editor and publisher of The Morning Call, a Tronc-owned daily newspaper in Allentown, Pa.

The New York Daily News is well known for sensational headlines that use strong loaded words such as this: Cuomo slams NYCHA, says agency ‘lied’ about handling tenant repair requests.

Editorially, the Daily News leans left, but has endorsed Republican George Bush for President as well as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: MIXED
Country: Hong Kong
World Press Freedom Rank: Hong Kong 76/180
History
Founded in 1903 by Australian Chinese revolutionary Tse Tsan-tai and British journalist Alfred Cunningham, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) is a Hong Kong based English-language newspaper. SCMP provides news, business, arts, tech and culture for global readers, with a focus on China and Asia. According to its about page, the South China Morning Post’s mission is to “Lead the global conversation about China.” SCMP is also Hong Kong’s newspaper of record and publishes fashion magazines, including Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan, Elle, Esquire and The Peak.
On April 5, 2016, Alibaba Group acquired SCMP Group in a $266 million deal including the South China Morning Post. Former CEO of Digg, Gary Liu is CEO of the South China Morning Post since 2017. Tammy Tam Wai Yee is the Editor-in-Chief. For a complete list of corporate executives please see here.
Funded by / Ownership
The South China Morning Post is owned by Alibaba Group and published by South China Morning Post Publishers Limited. It is funded through advertising and subscriptions.
Analysis / Bias
According to a Quartz article dated 2017, they state that after being acquired by Alibaba Group, SCMP’s narrative became more pro-China. The article also quotes Joseph Tsai, Alibaba’s co-founder and vice chairman, as saying “We wanted to tell the biggest story of our lifetime, which is China.” According to the NY Times, the new mission of SCMP is “improving China’s image overseas and combating what it sees as anti-Chinese bias in the foreign media.” Reuters points out that Jack Ma, the head of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is a Communist Party member.
In review, The South China Morning Post publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as this “Chinese companies moving to Vietnam keep quiet on trade war to avoid wrath of authorities and staff.” This article does not report favorably on China as evidenced by this quote from the article “Chinese state media may have launched a fierce propaganda campaign, placing the blame for the trade war squarely at the feet of the US government.” They further state “Companies are also fearful of growing hostility from local governments in China, should they announce their plans to relocate.” In another example of negative reporting on China, we examined their critical tone regarding China’s vaccine scandal, with this quote “Disease numbers are being swept under the carpet and false expiry dates slapped on injections, industry insiders say.” In general, articles are poorly sourced and lack hyperlinks.
When reporting U.S. news, they use minimally loaded language in their headlines such as “Donald Trump warns China to reach a trade deal now, or face a ‘far worse’ one if I get re-elected.” Again, when it comes to sourcing, they use quotes or source to themselves, rather than providing hyperlinks. They also write pro-China articles such as “Chinese President Xi Jinping warns of disaster if one civilisation imposes its will on another.”  Editorials tend be be pro- business such as this “Beijing could not give in to all US demands at recent talks out of concern for national dignity and matters of principle, so G20 may be last chance for the two leaders to meet ahead of an even more ferocious trade war.”
Although SCMP has been accused of promoting China, we find evidence that they cover both sides by being critical of China as well as praising them.
A factual search reveals that they have not failed a fact check.

Read our profile on USA government influence on media.
Funded by / Ownership
The New Civil Rights Movement is owned by AlterNet Media, which also publishes the progressive left news website alternet.org. Revenue is derived through advertising and donations for an ad free version of the website.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The New Civil Rights Movement summarizes news stories and publishes opinion based original commentary from a progressive liberal perspective. Headlines and articles often utilize emotional loaded wording that favors the left such as this: Pelosi is Doing What No One Else Had the Balls to Do: Making Trump Squirm. This story is sourced entirely to Twitter. NCRM also republishes articles from Raw Story and Alternet. 
Editorially, all commentary comes from progressive liberal perspective and often denigrates the right such as this BUSTED: Rudy Giuliani Outed for ‘Shadow Diplomacy’ With Venezuela — Similar to His Ukraine Scandal and this DOW Plunges After ‘Moron’ Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s Message From Mexico Spooks Markets. This latter story is sourced to Raw Story, which has a Mixed record with fact checkers. In general, all stories favor the left and often utilize left biased sources.
A factual search reveals a fair record with IFCN fact checkers.
Donald Trump donated flood relief money to the president of an anti-gay hate group. – Unproven

Overall, we rate The New Civil Rights Movement far Left Biased based on the use of loaded emotional language and editorial positions that favor the progressive left. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to the use of poor sources as well as a few failed fact checks. (D. Van Zandt 9/2/2017) Updated (12/30/2019)

Headlines and articles often contain loaded emotional language such as this: Prime Minister Blackface: It’s Time To Ban Assault Rifles. This story is properly sourced to the CBC, New York Times and Reuters. Story selection favors the right and usually denigrates the left such as this: Shocker: Another Member Of Democratic Practice Squad Pulls Out Of Primary Fight. Again, this story is properly sourced to the Associated Press and Real Clear Politics. Although Hot Air does not report negatively on President Trump, they also do not heap praise upon him like many other right leaning sources. They have also reported favorably on gay issues and editor Allahpundit is a proclaimed atheist. In general, Hot Air present news with a right leaning bias and typically sources their information properly, however some of their curated news comes from sources that we have rated questionable or factually mixed.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Hot Air Right Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that usually favor the right. We also them Mostly Factual in reporting, rather than High, due to the use of curated sources that have failed fact checks. However, Hot Air has not failed any fact checks to date. (D. Van Zandt 7/19/2017) Updated (9/21/2019)

Notes: AOL is an online magazine featuring a variety of content, from politics to lifestyle to video games. While they don’t carry a lot of political content, what they do carry is factual, well sourced and delivered with minimal bias. Despite a very slight left slant it is still well within the Least Biased category. (D. Kelley 3/3/2017)
Notes 2: In reviewing AOL I came up with a slightly different score. First, it must be pointed out that the majority of AOL news content is curated from other sources. The most common sources cited in the articles I reviewed were Business Insider (Left-Center), Reuters (Least Biased), AP (Least Biased) and ABC News (Left-Center). I rate their curated content to be low biased, with minimal loaded words and appropriately sourced. One the other hand, AOL produces its own news content that has a more editorial tone. The AOL produced content uses moderate loaded words and tends to favor the left in most stories. The articles are typically sourced to mostly left-center sources, and for the most part are rooted in fact. Based on their editorial type content I rate them moderate left-center and factually based.

National and international news comes almost exclusively from the Associated Press. All information is properly sourced either through links or first person accounting.
Editorially, the Colorado Gazette almost always endorses Republican candidates as evidenced by their 2018 endorsements: EDITORIAL: Gazette election endorsements 2018: Candidates. A review of editorial stories demonstrate that most favor the right, with many coming from the Right leaning Washington Examiner.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: MOSTLY FACTUAL
Country: United Kingdom
World Press Freedom Rank: UK 33/180
History
Notes: The Spectator is a weekly British conservative magazine. It was first published on 6 July 1828, making it the oldest continuously published magazine in the English language. The magazine covers politics, culture, and current affairs as well as arts pages on books, music, opera, and film and TV reviews.
Many previous editors of The Spectator have went on to have careers as conservative politicians. These include Boris Johnson (1999–2005) and other former cabinet members Iain Macleod, Ian Gilmour, and Nigel Lawson. The current editor is Fraser Nelson.
The Spectator also has USA and Australian versions.
Funded by / Ownership
The Spectator is currently owned by David and Frederick Barclay who also own the right leaning The Daily Telegraph newspaper, via Press Holdings. Revenue is generated through fee based subscriptions and the sale of classifieds advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Spectator primarily covers politics and culture with a right leaning bias in story selection. Headlines and articles usually contain moderately loaded language that favors the right such as this: Theresa May’s Brexit strategy has humiliated Britain and this Cambridge’s shameful decision to rescind Jordan Peterson’s visiting fellowship. Information contained in articles is typically properly sourced to credible media outlets or via direct quotes. The Spectator has also published misleading articles regarding climate change.
Editorially, The Spectator is generally Eurosceptic in outlook, favoring close ties with the United States rather than with the European Union, and supportive of Israel. In British politics they are generally strongly opposed to the Labour Party and favor the Conservative Party and are often critical of Conservative Party Prime Minister Theresa May for not being strong enough on Brexit.
A factual search reveals they have failed a few fact checks by an IFCN fact checker.

History
Founded in 2010, Lawfare is a blog dedicated to publishing information related to legal issues and policy related to national security. According to their about page “We mean to devote this blog to that nebulous zone in which actions taken or contemplated to protect the nation interact with the nation’s laws and legal institutions.”
Lawfare’s coverage of intelligence and legal matters related to the Trump administration has brought the blog significant increases in readership and national attention.
Lastly, the founder and Editor-in-Chief is Ben Wittes. They are also transparent by offering a masthead.
Funded by / Ownership
Lawfare is published in cooperation with the Brookings Institution and derives funding from donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website publishes articles from a legal perspective related to national security issues. Articles typically feature minimal to moderate loaded language such as this: The Potential Trouble with Nominating a DNI from Trump’s Central Casting. This story is properly sourced to the President’s daily briefs and the Washington Post. In fact, all articles reviewed are properly sourced to credible media outlets such as Reuters, Associated Press, Justice.gov and the New York Times. 
Although Lawfare is known for their straight factual reporting, they also produce editorial content that frequently discusses President Trump’s legal issues and policy that may not be constitutional. This reporting is always evidence based. In general, Lawfare is factual and utilizes minimal personal bias and does not takes sides. They clearly report on the law and how it impacts national security.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check. In fact, they are used as a resource for IFCN fact checkers.
Overall, we rate Lawfare Blog Least Biased based on evidence based balanced reporting. We also rate them Very High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and for being used as a resource for verified fact checkers. (5/14/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 7/30/2019)

History
Founded in 1851, Reuters is the world’s leading international multimedia news agency. It is headquartered in London, United Kingdom. Reuters was founded by Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, who moved to London and opened an office that transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. He had previously used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, which was also a common way to dispatch news. However, the Agence Havas (the predecessor of today’s AFP) was the first to start using the Morse telegraph. According to an article titled ”CHRONOLOGY: Reuters, from pigeons to multimedia merger”, overland telegraph and undersea cables enabled Reuters to expand its service beyond Europe to the Far East in 1872 and South America by 1874. During both World Wars, Reuters came under pressure from the British government to serve British interests. In 1941 Reuters avoided this pressure by restructuring itself as a private company. Stephen J. Adler is the President and Editor-in-Chief of Reuters.

Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, which is the world’s leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals and is owned by The Woodbridge Company Limited, which owns approximately 62.35% of common shares and is the principal and controlling shareholder of Thomson Reuters – see Fact Book 2017 (pg 83) and Annual Report 2017. The Woodbridge Company Limited is based in Toronto, Canada. The chief executive officer of Thomson Reuters is James (Jim) C. Smith, and the chairman is David Thomson, who is also a Chairman of Woodbridge. 
Analysis / Bias
In 2018, Reuters was named the winner of two Pulitzer Prizes on international reporting for exposing the methods of police killing squads in Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs and for feature photography documenting the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh.
In review, when covering Trump administration news, Reuters Editor In Chief wrote this message to staff “Covering Trump the Reuters Way” urging them to stick with the Reuters “Trust Principles.” However, after the Capital Gazette shooting, Reuters Breaking news editor Rob Cox tweeted “This is what happens when @realDonaldTrump calls journalists the enemy of the people. Blood is on your hands, Mr. President. Save your thoughts and prayers for your empty soul.” Cox later apologized and deleted the tweet. Regarding the incident Steve Adler, Editor-in-Chief, published a statement regarding Rob Cox’s tweet stating “Mr. Cox’s actions were inconsistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles requiring journalists to maintain freedom from bias. We do not condone his behavior and will take appropriate action.” 
In reporting, Reuters uses minimally biased emotional language in their headlines such as “Oregon right-wingers clash with anti-fascists at march in Portland” and “Trump lawyer Cohen vows to defend himself, puts family first: ABC News”, sourcing credible local sources such as the Oregonian newspaper and ABC news. In most cases Reuters journalists are the primary source of stories and consistently report with minimal bias, covering both sides of issues.
A factual search reveals that Reuters has an excellent track record with fact checkers.
Overall, we rate Reuters Least Biased based on objective reporting and Very High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information with minimal bias and a clean fact check record. (7/10/2016) Updated (M. Huitsing 10/24/2019)

Reuters is the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, which is the world’s leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals and is owned by The Woodbridge Company Limited, which owns approximately 62.35% of common shares and is the principal and controlling shareholder of Thomson Reuters – see Fact Book 2017 (pg 83) and Annual Report 2017. The Woodbridge Company Limited is based in Toronto, Canada. The chief executive officer of Thomson Reuters is James (Jim) C. Smith, and the chairman is David Thomson, who is also a Chairman of Woodbridge. ", United Kingdom,"Founded in 1851, Reuters is the world’s leading international multimedia news agency. It is headquartered in London, United Kingdom. Reuters was founded by Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, who moved to London and opened an office that transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. He had previously used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, which was also a common way to dispatch news. However, the Agence Havas (the predecessor of today’s AFP) was the first to start using the Morse telegraph. According to an article titled ”CHRONOLOGY: Reuters, from pigeons to multimedia merger”, overland telegraph and undersea cables enabled Reuters to expand its service beyond Europe to the Far East in 1872 and South America by 1874. During both World Wars, Reuters came under pressure from the British government to serve British interests. In 1941 Reuters avoided this pressure by restructuring itself as a private company. Stephen J. Adler is the President and Editor-in-Chief of Reuters.",,Center,

History
Founded in 1916 by Henry Hellsse, B.T. is a Danish tabloid newspaper which is published by Berlingske Media A/S and is headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark. The primary focus of B.T. is  news, sports and entertainment. Currently, its director is Anders Krab-Johansen and the editor-in-chief is Jonas Kuld Rathje.
Funded by / Ownership
B.T. is published by Berlingske Media A/S, which is owned by Belgian publishing company DPG Media. Revenue is derived through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
The current prime minister and leader of the Social Democrats is Mette Frederiksen. They are considered Center-Left, as they are left on economics, whereas skeptical of globalization, neoliberalism and immigration.
In review, B.T often covers crime stories with sensational headlines such as “29-year-old teacher admits having sex with two students” and Celebrity gossip with extensive use of images. B.T also publishes political articles with emotionally loaded language such as “Mette F.’s proposal is ‘totally unrealistic’”,  which is critical of the current government. Further, they also publish equally critical articles about populist, right wing Danish People’s Party (DPP) leader Kristian Thulesen Dahl, such as this: “Kristian Thulesen Dahl loses credibility.”  On the issues they frequently publish anti-immigration articles such as this: “Immigrant inbreeding costs millions” 
When it comes to sourcing, B.T. often hyperlinks to local sources such as tuttomercatoweb, videnskab.dk, jv.dk, as well as the Danish News Agency Ritzau, AFP and the Sequoyah County Times.  When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with a critical tone such as in this article “Trump breaks the law during a live broadcast” and this: The Supreme Court approves Trump’s contentious asylum restrictions. In general, B.T. publishes sensationalized stories with the occasional use of poor sources and a right leaning editorial bias.
A factual search reveals they have not been fact checked by an IFCN fact checker.
Overall, we rate B.T. Right-Center Biased based on editorial positions that moderately favor the right. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting, rather than High, due to the occasional use of poor sources and sensationalized headlines. (M. Huitsing 12/18/2019)

Detailed Report

History
Founded in 2011 by Dan Abrams, The Mary Sue is a news and opinion website that focuses mostly on entertainment and technology news. According to their about page “The Mary Sue is the geek girl’s guide to the universe. We pride ourselves on being an inclusive, feminist community of people who not only love what they love but care about others who love it and have an intense passion for those who create it.” The current editors are Kaila Hale-Stern and Dan Van Winkle.
Funded by / Ownership
The Mary Sue is owned by the Abrams Media Network, which also owns the left leaning Mediaite. The website generates revenue though advertising, subscription fees and sells Mary Sue branded products.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Mary Sue offers news and opinions of geek culture from a female perspective. Topics covered are gaming, technology, entertainment and politics. When covering politics there is a strong left leaning bias in story selection and wording such as this: Twitter Creates Epic Ivanka Trump Memes After Her Embarrassing Attempt to Interact with World Leaders and this Donald Trump Is Planning the Worst Fourth of July Party. This latter story is appropriately sourced to left leaning sources such as the Washington Post, Huff Post and Vox. Many articles offer a pro-feminist perspective such as this: We’re Here for Two Teenagers Who Started a Feminist Club at Their All-Male School. In general, story selection and political advocacy aligns with the left.
A factual search reveals one failed fact check by an IFCN fact checker that was not corrected.

Overall, we rate Metro UK Left-Center Biased based on editorial positions that favor the left. We also rate them Mixed in reporting due to a few false claims that was not corrected and many sensationalized headlines and stories.
Detailed Report

Country: United Kingdom
World Press Freedom Rank: UK 33/180

Read our report on UK media and government.
Funded by / Ownership
The Metro is owned by DMG Media, which is a national newspaper and website publisher in the UK. It is a subsidiary of DMGT. The paper is funded through sponsored content and advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Metro covers local news through staff journalists with the use of minimal to moderate loaded language such as this: ‘Serious’ explosion engulfs Peterborough Whirlpool factory in flames. This story is sourced through videos, pictures and first person accounts. The story also covers sensationalized tabloid fare such as this: Try telling this woman her prorogue rage is ‘phoney’
Political news reporting is usually balanced and sourced, however opinion pieces are almost always opposed to the right. For example this article: Boris Johnson is no better than a tin-pot dictator. In general news reporting is relatively low biased, with several sensationalized pieces mixed in and op-eds moderately left leaning in tone.
A factual search reveals several failed or misleading fact checks.
False claims of a coming ice age spread through ecosystem of unreliable news sites, blogs, and social media accounts – FALSE (Note: this story was corrected)
A couple seeking to conceive via IVF discovered through DNA testing that they were fraternal twins. – FALSE
DID THE JAMKARAN MOSQUE IN IRAN RAISE A RED FLAG OF REVENGE FOR ‘THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY’? – FALSE
Overall, we rate Metro UK Left-Center Biased based on editorial positions that favor the left. We also rate them Mixed in reporting due to a few false claims that was not corrected and many sensationalized headlines and stories. (D. Van Zandt 2/11/2017) Updated (12/12/2019)

Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The Daily Dot is owned by Daily Dot, LLC, which is based in Austin, Texas. Revenue is primarily derived from advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the Daily Dot mostly covers technology news, but also covers culture and politics. For the purpose of this bias review we will focus on politics. The Daily Dot, at worst uses moderately loaded language in headlines with most being minimal such as this: MAGA bomber sentenced to 20 years in prison. This story is properly sourced. When reporting on President Trump the Daily Dot does not have a favorable view, with articles such as this: WTF was Donald Trump doing with his hand at last night’s rally? and this: The latest terrifying deepfake combines Donald Trump and Mr. Bean. This story is also appropriately sourced to credible left leaning sources such as Vox and the Washington Post. 
When it comes to science, they support the consensus across the board such as this on GMO’s: Nobel laureates urge Greenpeace to drop its crusade against GMOs. In general, the Daily Dot holds a strong left leaning editorial position, while reporting news factually and with evidence.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the Daily Dot Left Biased based on editorial positions that mostly favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (5/13/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 8/05/2019)

Analysis / Bias
In review, IBT publishes slightly left leaning tabloid style, attention-grabbing stories, or those with shock value such as: “Passenger’s Repeated Farts Force Airline To Make Emergency Landing” and” “Dustin Snyder, Teenage Cancer Patient, Dies Weeks After Marrying Girlfriend.”
In their articles, The International Business Times publishes news stories utilizing credible news sources such as The Daily Beast and Atlanta Journal-Constitution. They also utilize factually mixed sources such as Fox News and Daily Mirror. The International Business Times sometimes reports news such as “Man Claims He Time Traveled From 2048 To Warn Of Alien Invasion.”  This story originally appeared in Huff Po as “Weird News”, however The International Business Times / IBT published this story as “National News.” Further, The International Business Times has made a false claim that was identified by fact checkers.
Overall, we rate IBT Mixed for factual reporting due to a false claim and use of factually mixed sources and Left-Center biased due to story selection that slightly favors the left.

History
Founded in 1987, France Info is a French news radio and 24hr TV news broadcaster with a website that was launched in 2011. It is owned by Radio France, which also operates other national radio stations as well as many local ones under the umbrella of Radio France. France Info later integrated its news with TV news channel France TV Info (2016). Radio and TV broadcasting in France are considered public services with the French State having direct control over public broadcasting.
France Info covers political news, live debates, culture, lifestyle and political analysis programs as well as creating videos which mainly targets a younger audience. The site has the following sections politique, faits divers, société, éco/conso, monde, culture, sports, santé, sciences, tech/web, Environnement, météo, vrai ou fake (true or fake). They are based in Paris, France. Currently, the Chief Executive Officer of Radio France is Jean-Luc Vergne. Here is the complete list of editorial staff. 
Funded by / Ownership
Radio France and France Television owns France Info. Radio France and France Television are both funded by The State and they also generate revenue from TV license fees and commercial advertising.
According to a Bloomberg article titled “France Considers Relaxing Its Archaic Broadcasting Rules”, Macron’s Government is planning 190 million euros in spending cuts by 2022 from its public radio and TV broadcasting. 
Analysis / Bias
In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked France 32th out of 180 countries in the world stating “Attacks and harassment targeting news media and journalists increased dangerously in 2018.”
Currently, Emmanuel Macron is the President of France, he is also the leader and founder of the centrist and liberal La République En Marche party (REM). 
In review, Radio Info publishes articles with minimally loaded emotional language such as “Macron “Strike of December 5: Emmanuel Macron remains determined”. When covering world news, pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump Administration with a critical tone such as in this: “The election of Donald Trump worries businesses in the region that export to the United States.” France Info typically utilizes credible sources such as the Miami Herald, CBS News, France 24, and UN.org.
The website also features a section called True or Fake that performs well sourced fact checks. Although not a signatory of the IFCN, their fact checks are credible. Finally, the website does not publish op-eds, though a broad review of story selection indicates a slight leftward bias.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate France Info slightly Left-Center Biased based on story selection that lightly favors liberal causes. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (M. Huitsing 12/13/2019)

Notes: Founded in 1928, the Montana Standard is a print newspaper serving the Butte area of Montana. The paper is owned by Lee Enterprises, which according to Open Secrets has donated 88% of it money to Republican politicians since 1990.
In review, the Montana Standard covers local news with journalists and reporters throughout the Butte region. For national news they use the Associated Press. All news is reported with minimal loaded words and bias. The Montana Standard always sources their information properly. Editorially, there is a balance between right and left leaning opinions with just a slight edge to the left.
Overall, we rate the Montana Standard Least Biased due to a mostly balanced editorial page and High for factual reporting based on proper sourcing. (D. Van Zandt 4/14/2018)

Notes: Founded in 1928, the Montana Standard is a print newspaper serving the Butte area of Montana. The paper is owned by Lee Enterprises, which according to Open Secrets has donated 88% of it money to Republican politicians since 1990.
In review, the Montana Standard covers local news with journalists and reporters throughout the Butte region. For national news they use the Associated Press. All news is reported with minimal loaded words and bias. The Montana Standard always sources their information properly. Editorially, there is a balance between right and left leaning opinions with just a slight edge to the left.
Overall, we rate the Montana Standard Least Biased due to a mostly balanced editorial page and High for factual reporting based on proper sourcing. (D. Van Zandt 4/14/2018)

Defense One is a property of Atlantic Media, which owns the left leaning Atlantic Magazine and website. Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
The articles are well written, well sourced, and highly factual. National defense and security are always complex and controversial subjects. The solid analysis and insight that DO provides can be a key path to navigating and understanding them.  While some of the articles exhibit a slight left or right bias, this can be attributed primarily to the subject matter as opposed to the bias of the author. That aside, the overall content and editorial intent of DO earns them a Least Biased rating.
A factual search reveals Defense One has not failed a fact check.

Country: United Kingdom
World Press Freedom Rank: UK 33/180
History
Established in 1785, as The Daily Universal Register, The Times is a British newspaper based in London, UK. The website was established in 1999.
The Times was founded by publisher John Walter and adopted its current name in 1788.  In 1981, News Corporation acquired both The Times and The Sunday Times. The current editor of The Times is John Witherow.
The Sunday Times is a print newspaper that publishes content on The Times website. The Sunday Times is the largest-selling British national newspaper in the “quality press” market category and the editor is Martin Ivens.
Read our report on UK government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The Times and Sunday Times is owned by News UK (News Corp UK & Ireland Limited), which is owned by American News Corp. The owner and Executive Chairman of News Corp is Rupert Murdoch. Revenue is derived from advertising and subscriptions fees.
Analysis / Bias
In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked UK 33rd out of 180 in their Press Freedom Index.
The BBC reports The Times supported the Labour Party (left) in 2001 and 2005, however, it backed the Conservative Party (right) during European elections in June and in 2008 they endorsed Boris Johnson for London mayor. During the 2017 general elections, the Guardian reports The Times endorsement was not final, however it supported the election of Theresa May. On the other hand, The Sunday Times endorsed The Conservatives: “Wake up, smell the coffee and vote Conservative”  
During the Brexit referendum, The Times was pro-remain, but after the referendum they were backing Theresa May’s exit deal.
Currently, Theresa May is the Prime Minister, however, as of June 7 she resigned as leader of the Conservative Party. Currently, there is an ongoing contest to decide who will be the party leader and consequently the new prime minister. As of the time of this analysis, there is an ongoing contest within the party, with Boris Johnson being the front runner against Secretary of State Jeremy Hunt. The winner will become the next Conservative leader and prime minister by the end of July 2019.
In review, The Times utilizes emotionally loaded headlines such as “Tory leadership race: Bust-up with Carrie Symonds raises new doubts over Boris Johnson’s fitness to lead” and “Johnson takes a leading role in age of buffoonery.”  A quote from the article reads “Britain will soon be run by the buffoon-in-chief. Otherwise known as mini-Trump.” When it comes to the US and Trump administration, the tone is negative towards President Trump, such as “Trump sold nuclear tech to Saudis in secret after Khashoggi killing” . When it comes to sourcing they often sources back to themselves, rather than hyperlinking to external sources.
The Sunday Times slightly differs from The Times in that they have stronger conservative editorial positions. They also produce more investigative journalism through their Insight Investigative Team.
A factual search reveals they that neither source has failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate The Times and Sunday Times Right-Center biased based on story selection and editorial positions that favors the right and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record. (7/19/2016) Updated (M. Huitsing 6/22/2019)

Detailed Report

Country: Israel
World Press Freedom Rank: Israel 88/180
History
Founded in 2012, The Times of Israel is an online newspaper published in English, Arabic, French, Chinese, and Persian which covers “developments in Israel, the Middle East and around the Jewish world”.  In addition to publishing news reports and analysis, The Times of Israel hosts a multi-author blog platform. Its headquarters are in Jerusalem. The co-founder and editor is David Horovitz. The other co-founder is American billionaire Seth Klarman, founder of the Baupost Group and chairman of The David Project. Klarman is the chairman of the website.
According to their about page “The Times of Israel has no partisan political affiliation. It seeks to present the news fair-mindedly and offers a wide range of analysis and opinion pieces.”
Funded by / Ownership
The Times of Israel is co-owned by David Horovitz and Seth Klarman. Revenue is generated through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Times of Israel covers Israeli and regional news with minimally loaded language such as this: US envoy suggests world should rethink PA aid after Israeli teen killed by bomb. This particular story relies on Twitter as the primary source. In another story, Ex-Iraqi PM warns Israel of ‘strong response’ if it proves to be behind strikes, the primary source is the New York Times. The Times of Israel also relies on news agencies for content such as the Associated Press and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. 
The website also features a blog with a wide variety of writers. The blog posts tend to use more emotional wording and are generally opinion oriented. A review of several blog post indicate a left leaning editorial bias with articles such as this: What Trump really (maybe) meant by calling Jewish Democrats ‘disloyal’. When covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict they usually are objective and cover both sides fairly, such as this: IDF strikes fresh Hamas targets after 2nd rocket fired from Gaza Strip. In general, the Times of Israel is factual with a slight left leaning editorial bias.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the Times of Israel Left-Center biased based on editorial positions that slightly favor the left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 12/5/2016) Updated (8/23/2019)

History
Launched in 1872, the Mainichi Shimbun is an English language, Japanese daily broadsheet newspaper. Mainichi Shimbun features world and national news, opinion, economy, politics and photo journals. They are headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The newspaper does not list the staff names, therefore the editor is unknown.  
Funded by / Ownership
Mainichi Shimbun is owned by The Mainichi Newspapers Co, Ltd., which is a subsidiary of The Mainichi Newspapers Group Holdings Co., Ltd. The Mainichi Newspapers Co. President is Masahiro Maruyama. Revenue is derived through advertising and subscription fees.
Analysis / Bias
In Japan, The Prime Minister is the head of government. The current Prime Minister is Abe Shinzō, who is the leader of the conservative, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and known for his nationalistic conservatism. Japan also uses a “Press Club” system, which may compromise the independence of the press.
In review, although at the end of most articles, Mainichi Shimbun state the author’s name, they do not provide biographical information regarding the author or the editor. Furthermore, articles are poorly sourced, for example, a quote from an article reads: “Governments of all types across Japan have begun campaigns to encourage foreign tourists to purchase travel insurance, with a recent surge in people leaving unpaid medical bills putting pressure on Japanese hospital budgets.” This statement is not hyperlinked to a source that supports the claim. However, when they do source information they use credible sources such as the Tokyo City News Department or their own national bureaus and for international news coverage they utilize the Associated Press.
Mainichi Shimbun is known for its left leaning stance and when covering news they utilize emotionally loaded language that is critical of Abe Shinzo: “Author claims publisher cut ties after he criticized book by writer close to Japan PM” and “Deputy PM Aso faces censure motion over funds needed for post-retirement lives”.
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, articles are generally written with a neutral tone such as “Trump to inspect Japanese destroyer with Abe in late May”, and again they tend not to hyperlink.
A factual search reveals that they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Mainichi Shimbun Left-Center biased based on story selection and editorial positions that moderately favor the left and High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record. (M. Huitsing 6/21/2019)

Analysis / Bias
NBC News is what some call a mainstream media source. They typically publish/report factual news that uses moderately loaded words in headlines such as this: Trump threatens border security shutdown, GOP cool to idea. Story selection tends to favor the left through both wording and bias by omission where they under report some news stories that are favorable to the right. NBC always sources their information to credible sources that are either low biased or high for factual reporting. 
A 2014 Pew Research Survey found that 42% of NBC News’ audience is consistently or mostly liberal, 39% Mixed and 19% consistently or mostly conservative. This indicates that NBC is preferred by a more liberal audience.
A factual search reveals that NBC News has failed one fact check.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: MIXED
Country: United Kingdom
World Press Freedom Rank: UK 33/180
History
Launched on 2004, Guido Fawkes (order-order.com) is a British right-wing, tabloid-style blog founded by Paul Staines. According to the Guardian Paul Staines is a “former member of the Committee for a Free Britain, a shadowy organisation funded by Sir James Goldsmith and Rupert Murdoch.” Harry Cole is listed as part of the editorial team together with Paul Staines. Cole is also contributing editor for The Spectator and writes a gossip column for GQ.
Read our media profile on the United Kingdom.
Funded by / Ownership
The founder of Guido Fawkes (order-order.com) Paul Staines also co-founded with Jag Singh a company called Message Space, which is a profitable digital advertising agency that hosts viral marketing campaigns and sells ads across a network of political blogs. According to a Guardian interview (2011) the combined Order-Order and Message Space turnover is about £150,000 a year and allows Staines to employ a full-time advertising sales team.
Analysis / Bias
According to a Guardian interview, Political blogger, aka Guido Fawkes describes himself as ‘anarcho-libertarian, or Thatcherite on drugs.’ The blog publishes scandals related to politicians with Guido stating its aim is to expose rumors and conspiracies of Westminster.
In review, Guido Fawkes (order-order.com) utilizes emotionally loaded language in its headlines such as “ANDREA JENKYNS: BREXIT LEGEND” and “DOG WHISTLE LABOUR MESSAGES SENT TO MUSLIM VOTERS.” These blog posts often display social media posts from Twitter or Facebook with Paul Staines writing short comments such as Theresa May’s policies “will mercilessly target our communities, our places of worship and all areas of our lives”. Worrying stuff…”
Essentially, Guido Fawkes is adding a few opinionated soundbites to their blog posts with the hope of increasing discussion to encourage clicking (Clickbait) or sharing on social media. Generally all stories favor the right with many having a nationalist tone and are poorly sourced. Further, this source down plays climate change by publishing articles that show Polar Bears are thriving and demonstrating that green energy is too costly.
Overall, we rate Guido Fawkes Right Biased due to word choices that favor the Right and Mixed for factual reporting based on poor sourcing. (M. Huitsing 6/13/2018) Updated (10/18/2019)

A review of the opinion page reflects mostly balanced coverage with some clearly in favor of the left.
In general, news reporting is balanced and low biased, with op-ed’s having a slight lean left. Under Rupert Murdoch, Sky News was frequently accused of having a right wing bias, however, the left leaning New Statesman does not agree, and concludes that Sky News is impartial.
A factual search reveals that Sky News has failed one fact check.

History
Vice Magazine was founded in 1994 by Shane Smith, Suroosh Alvi, and Gavin McInnes in Montreal, Canada.  In this interview with Suroosh Alvi, he provides details how Vice was born. In 1998, the partners sold part of Vice to Montreal software magnate Richard Szalwinski, however soon they bought the magazine back. Once called “Voice of Montreal” they eventually changed the name to Vice. In 1999, Vice relocated its base to New York City and became Vice Media, which grew into a digital media company that publishes online and in print magazines and expanded into millennial-driven media consisting of a website, broadcast news unit, a film production company, a record label, and a publishing imprint and more.  Its news division, Vice News launched in 2013 and focused around news and current events. Currently, Nancy Dubuc is the CEO and Shane Smith is the Executive Chairman. According to its about page, Suroosh Alvi & Shane Smith are listed as owners, whereas Gavin McInnes is not listed since he left due to “creative differences”.  Gavin McInnes, later founded the Proud Boys which is defined as hate group.

Funded by / Ownership
According to Forbes, Shane Smith owns approximately (20%) and the rest of the shares belongs to The Walt Disney Company, A&E Networks, TPG Capital (the private equity group), and 21st Century Fox. Vice Media missed revenue targets by $100m and according to a Forbes article“ Disney wrote down $157m of its investment in Vice” which indicates a sign of trouble “for the youth-focused media company.” Further, CNBC reports Vice is reportedly reducing staff by 15%. Vice News is funded primarily through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In 2017, investigative reporting by Emily Steel of the New York Times, uncovered mistreatment and sexual harassment of women and workplace culture at Vice Media, which was described by ex-employees as toxic. Following the report, Vice Media President Andrew Creighton resigned, which then CEO and now Executive Chairman Shane Smith has acknowledged and apologized, promising change. The company later announced that they established a Diversity and Inclusion Board.
In review, Vice News offers a progressive liberal perspective in reporting such as “Millennials Don’t Love Capitalism but Can’t Stop Using Amazon”.  Vice News has an anti-Trump tone in their articles such as This Is What It Takes for a Trump Voter to Change Their Mind and “Trump Foundation is shutting down after the New York AG called it “little more than a checkbook” for Trump.” However, Vice News utilizes credible sources such as the Washington Post, ocf.berkeley.edu, Vox , AP, ag.ny.gov, Forbes, Washington Examiner, Business Insider , census.gov, and the NY Times. In general, more stories favor the left and present a more favorable left leaning perspective on issues.

Detailed Report
Factual Reporting: MOSTLY FACTUAL
Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 1994, CounterPunch is a bi-monthly magazine published in the United States that covers politics in a manner its editors describe as “muckraking with a radical attitude”. It has been described as left-wing by both supporters and detractors. The current editors are Jeffrey St. Clair and Joshua Frank.
During the 2016 presidential election, CounterPunch published the writings of Alice Donovan who purported to be a freelance writer but was in fact a pseudonymous employee of the Russian government. Following this, CounterPunch wrote a follow-up article in which “St. Clair and Frank exposed a network of alleged trolls that operated a site called Inside Syria Media Center promoting a pro-Bashar al-Assad and pro-Russian view of the Syrian Civil War. St. Clair and Frank speculated that the website was connected to the same network of trolls as Alice Donovan.”
CounterPunch has also been accused of Antisemitism, which stemmed from an interview with Roger Waters.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
CounterPunch is owned by The Institute for the Advancement of Journalistic Clarity who’s “mission is to help readers make informed and balanced assessments – vital for a healthy democratic society – on the public issues of the day. It does this by providing credible reporting and commentary in its magazine CounterPunch, on its website (www.counterpunch.org) and by publishing non-fiction books.” CounterPunch generates revenue through book sales, donations, grants and advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, CounterPunch presents news and opinions with a strong progressive left bias in story selection. Most stories favor the left and use loaded language such as these: The Blob Fought the Squad, and the Squad Won and The Immoral Silence to the Destructive Xenophobia of “Just Leave”. This latter piece does not indicate it is an opinion article and provides zero hyperlinked sources to vet those opinions. CounterPunch also regularly praises and highlights Julian Assange of Wikileaks, who outright lied and created the Seth Rich conspiracy theory. When it comes to politics, CounterPunch favors Democratic Socialism such as this: Bernie Sanders, Anti-Imperialism and Venezuela. The general editorial position of CounterPunch is Left.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Ceasefire publishes articles with emotionally loaded headlines such as “Has the world forgotten about Jamal Khashoggi?”
They also publish articles strongly biased both against the Labor party such as this: “What kind of Labour anti-racist movement do we want? A quote from the article reads “Given the history of Labour and its role as an administrator of capitalism within the British state, something that isn’t going to change with Corbyn” and against the Conservative party such as “Hollow Man: Boris Johnson’s delusions of grandeur won’t survive reality.” and this Chronicle of a Coup Foretold: Boris Johnson’s assault on democracy must be stopped. Boris Johnson is currently serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party. 
In the past, Ceasefire published scientific articles such as “Beyond the Higgs Boson: can future choices really affect the past?”  However, the last article was published in 2012.  Ceasefire also conducts interviews such as this with Former Greek Minister of Finance, Yanis Varoufakis: “Never before have we had so much money, yet so little investment in what humanity needs.”
Ceasefire utilizes credible sources such as The Independent, The Guardian, Morningstaronline, and the Irish Times.

History
Founded in 2011, Medical Xpress is a website that provides medical and health news through the Science X Network. Science X publishes around 200 articles per day between Medical Xpress and its other properties Phys.org and Tech Xplore. 
Funded by / Ownership
Medical Xpress is owned by Science X, which is wholly owned by Omicron Technology Limited, headquartered in Douglas, Isle Of Man, United Kingdom. Revenue is derived from onsite advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Medical Xpress is a health and medical news source which also publishes articles about the recent development in the health care industry and research in the field of medical science. News and research articles are typically republished from other sources such as University studies, press releases and organizations. Articles are low biased and usually pro-science such as this article republished from the American Heart Association: Aerobic exercise programs may improve endurance, walking after stroke. Further, because Medical Xpress publishes from a wide range or journals and sources, they sometimes publish studies that may lack peer review or contradict the current consensus. This does not mean they are inaccurate, but rather just new studies that will require more testing and peer review.
Overall, we rate Medical Xpress, a generally credible Pro-Science source, that occasionally publishes new studies that are outside of the current consensus of science for that field. (D. Van Zandt 8/24/2016) Updated (8/14/2019)

History
Founded in 1917, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) is an international news agency and wire service serving Jewish community newspapers and media around the world, with 88 subscriber outlets listed on its web site. The JTA has been described as the Associated Press of the Jewish Community.
Funded by / Ownership
The JTA is a not-for-profit corporation governed by an independent Board of Directors. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency is funded through donations and online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In reviewing articles the JTA displays minimal bias in wording and sources to credible information. There is an obvious pro-Israel bias in reporting as the news is geared toward the interests of the Jewish Community. With that said, from a right-left standpoint this is a least biased source for news reporting and is factual for reliable information.
Overall, we rate JTA Least biased from a left-right perspective, but pro-Israel in their political stance. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing. (D. Van Zandt 7/23/2017) Updated (7/29/2018)

In review, The Verge primarily covers technology and science, with less emphasis on politics. However, when covering politics they generally use minimally loaded words such as this: Presidential hopeful John Delaney wants you to unfollow Trump on Twitter. This story like most are properly sourced to credible left leaning media sources such as the Daily Beast and Washington Post. Political news is typically related to technology or science information and not just politics in general. When it comes to science reporting The Verge aligns with the consensus of science. The Verge does not produce political editorial content, though story selection tends to slightly favor the left.

World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 1969, the Washington Monthly is a bimonthly liberal leaning nonprofit magazine and website of politics and government. According to their about page their primary focus is on Government reform: “We don’t chase news cycles, or obsess over the endless political horse race. We care about how the government can be improved, and why it hasn’t; who’s a fraud and who isn’t; which ideas ought to be banished from the nation’s capital and which ones deserve to be championed.”
The Washington Monthly lists a Masthead, which indicates the Editor-in-Chief is Paul Glastris.
Funded by / Ownership
The Washington Monthly is funded through advertising, subscription fees and donations. They receive donations from individual donors as well as large corporations and foundations. On their about page they clearly list their tops donors as follows:
Stephen M. Silberstein Foundation
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
California Healthcare Foundation
Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation
Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
The Kresge Foundation
Lumina Foundation
NIHCM Foundation
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
The Robin Hood Foundation
Rockefeller Brothers Fund
The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation
Analysis / Bias
In review, The Washington Monthly publishes news and commentary regarding Washington DC politics. Story selection often favors the left and utilizes moderately emotional language such as this: Trump Won’t Buck His Base to Address Gun Violence. This story is appropriately sourced to the New York Times. In another article, The Electoral College Is Not What Its Defenders Say It Is, they advocate for the left leaning position of replacing the electoral college with a popular vote. This article is properly sourced as well to numerous credible media and information outlets. 
Editorially, the Washington Monthly clearly favors Democratic party positions, however they tend to report with caution when covering the more progressive wing of the party: What Sanders and Warren Get Wrong on Free College. In general, they generally hold mostly left-center positions and report information factually and backed with evidence.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the Washington Monthly Left-Center Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that favor moderate Democratic positions. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to excellent sourcing and a clean fact check record. (5/15/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 09/07/2019)

History
Founded in Guangzhou, China on April 1, 1924, the Central News Agency (CNA) is Taiwan’s state run national news agency and it is operated by the Chinese government. Focus Taiwan is the English language news website of the Central News Agency (CNA). According to their about page, in 1996 after a law passed by the Legislative Yuan, CNA reorganized and became a nonprofit corporation.
CNA focuses on news, politics, sports, entertainment, business and technology. Currently, the CNA President is Chang Jui-chang and the CNA Chairman is Liu Ka-shiang who is also a writer, nature observer and veteran journalist. CNA is based in Taipei, Taiwan
Funded by / Ownership
The Central News Agency’s (CNA) overseeing authority is the Taiwanese Ministry of Culture who appoints the chairman and the board. According to an article published in 2013 by the Taipei Times “The CNA (Central News Agency) and the PTS (Public Television Service) receive about NT$300 million and NT$900 million (US $9.9 million and US $29.9 million) in government funding each year respectively.” In 2018, Culture Minister Cheng Li-chiun announced that Public Television Service (PTS), Central News Agency (CNA), Radio Taiwan International (RTI), and Chinese Television System (CTS) will all be merged into one “media group.” They further report “The new organisation will also require substantial and sustainable funding from a public media development fund, potentially a mix of public, self-raised and private investment, which will eventually remove government funding.” Revenue is derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In 2019 Reporters Without Borders ranked Taiwan 42 out of 180 countries in their Press Freedom Index.
Currently, the President of Taiwan is Tsai Ing-wen, who is a member of the center-left Democratic Progressive Party and also The first woman to be elected to the office . 
In review, CNA publishes articles with neutral language such as “President Tsai unveils growth roadmap for southern Taiwan”, and reports with balance, representing both sides. For example, in the same article they also publish the opposition KMT (Center-Right) presidential candidate Daniel Han Kuo-yu’s view, who is running against president Tsai Ing-wen. In another article that reports on same sex marriage their is again little bias present: “Taiwan records almost 1,200 gay marriages, 2 divorces since May 24”.

When it comes to sourcing, CNA’s media partners include the Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse, Deutsche Welle, and Bloomberg. However, articles often do not contain hyperlinks. When covering world news, pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump admin with a neutral tone such as in this: “Trump approves F-16 sale to Taiwan.”  Scientifically, CNA is generally pro-science with news stories concerned about climate change. 
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate Central News Agency (CNA) / Focus Taiwan, Left-Center Biased based on significant funding from the Government, which is currently ruled by the Democratic Progressive Party. However, this rating may change in the future when Government funding is removed.  We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. (M.

Analysis / Bias
The Nikkei is known for its conservative views and according to the Japan Times, it is often criticized by “depending too much on leaks — apparently provided by corporate insiders — and the paper is often seen as reluctant to bluntly criticize Japanese firms.” Further, Niemanlab quotes New York Times reporter Hiroko Tabuchi after the Nikkei’s purchase of the FT “Worrying. Nikkei is basically a PR machine for Japanese biz; it initially ignored the 2011 Olympus accounting scandal (which FT broke). Nikkei has also hardly covered the Takata airbag defect; almost no investigative work on that issue whatsoever. Nikkei is Japan Inc.”
When covering news geared towards Southeast Asian countries, Nikkei Asian Review utilizes minimally loaded emotional language such as this: “Prayuth close to securing Thai PM job as king backs senate” and “Japan venture specialist to launch $27m fund for India startups”, however information is not sourced though hyperlinking. 
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they use loaded language such as this quote from an article that reads “The Abe-Trump summit in Washington in late April showed how Trump has driven U.S. trade policy into a dead end.” Once again there is a lack of hyperlinked sourcing.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

History
Founded in 2011, the College Fix is a conservative news blog run by the Student Free Press Association which is a nonprofit organization run by veteran journalists to help beginning journalists. The veteran journalists in this case are all conservatives. The College Fix typically writes about higher education news, but also covers politics.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The College Fix is owned by the Student Free Press Association, which is a nonprofit run by journalists. The website lacks transparency as they do not disclose top donors.  However, a search reveals they have been funded by Koch Industries and The Bradley Foundation. Revenue is also derived through advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The College Fix reports news on higher education as well as politics from a conservative perspective. Many articles focus on political correctness and utilizes moderate emotional language such as this: Student affairs officers have low view of students’ understanding of free speech, survey finds. The website also publishes news stories from other sources, including Inside Higher Education such as this: After sudden coronavirus evictions, universities demand students pay to get their stuff back. For the most part news articles are reasonably sourced to credible media outlets and are not overly opinionated.
Editorially, The College Fix appropriately labels opinion content. Virtually all op-eds reviewed favors conservative positions such as anti-abortion positions and negative reporting on Feminism: Guilt-first feminists accuse school dance policy of promoting ‘rape culture’. In general story selections strongly aligns with the right and is sometimes not factual.
Failed Fact Checks
A significant and growing number of college students support “post-birth abortions,” extending to children as old as four or five. – False
“Students at the University of Texas in Austin have been advised not to wear cowboy boots or cowboy hats on Halloween.” – False
California State Universities Offering Segregated ‘Blacks Only’ Housing? – False
Muslim students removed wooden pews from Wichita State University’s chapel because they lacked a place in which to kneel and pray. – False
Overall, we rate The College Fix strongly Right Biased based on story selection and editorials that consistently aligns with the conservative right. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to several failed checks. (D. Van Zandt 3/8/2017) Updated (4/8/2020)

Analysis / Bias
According to a Politico interview with the editor, Ezra Klein, Klein describes their goal as “to use technology to improve readers’ experience and understanding of events”. Vox has introduced Vox Card Stacks and with those cards they organize information, in index card format, about all kinds of topics that were in the news with in-depth details but in a summary form. Some examples are: “Everything you need to know about Israel-Palestine” and “The spread of marijuana legalization, explained.”  Vox also has a feature called StoryStream where they provide real-time updates to news stories.
In review, Vox looks at the issues from a progressive liberal perspective and there is also an anti-Trump tone in their reporting. Therefore, the majority of stories are pro-left and anti-right. Further, Vox publishes stories with emotionally loaded headlines such as “Are Democrats brave enough to run a woman against Donald Trump?” and “The most depressing energy chart of the year- Coal has got to go” When it comes to sourcing, Vox typically utilizes credible sources such as the NY Times, Associated Press, and Bloomberg.
A factual search reveals two failed fact checks.

In review, Global Citizen utilizes minimally loaded emotional words in their headlines and articles such as “This Is the Powerful Message the ‘National Teacher of the Year’ Shared With President Trump” and “How Bill Gates Hopes $1.7 Billion Can Transform the US Education System”. However, Global Citizen’s articles are always backed up by utilizing credible sources such as The Guardian, ccsso.org, .unhcr.org, carbonbrief.org, rwjf.org, and worldbank.org. The story selection of Global Citizen has a left leaning, progressive viewpoint and they have never failed a fact check.

Analysis / Bias
In review, The Daily Signal reports on political news and policy with a right leaning bias in both story selection and wording such as this: Osama Bin Laden Was Right. This article is critical of President Trump’s decision to leave Syria, arguing that pulling out will result in “at some point having to fight them again on U.S. soil.” In other words, the Daily Signal supports a more right leaning interventionist Neoconservative military approach. In another article, there is moderate use of loaded language in the headline to portray the Mueller investigation negatively: Mueller Investigation Stirring Up More Trouble Than It’s Finding.  This particular story is republished directly from the Tribune Content Agency. Other stories are republished from the factually Mixed Daily Caller. Original news stories such as this one are typically properly sourced through hyperlinking to credible media sources.
Editorially, The Daily Signal consistently casts doubt on the role of humans in climate change with articles such as this: Climate Change Alarmism Is the World’s Leading Cause of Hot Gas. Further all opinion pieces favor the right and denigrates the left.
In general, story selection and editorials almost always favor the right, though at times The Daily Signal is critical of Donald Trump.
A factual search reveals that the Daily Signal has not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate the Daily Signal, Right Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that always favor the right. We also rate them Mostly Factual, rather than High, due to not aligning with the consensus of science regarding human influenced climate change. (D. Van Zandt 7/19/2016) Updated (11/22/2019)

Detailed Report

History
Twitchy is an American Twitter curation and news website founded by conservative commentator Michelle Malkin in 2012. According to their about page “Twitchy is a ground-breaking social media curation site powered by a kinetic staff of social media junkies. We mine Twitter to bring you “who said what” in U.S. & global news, sports, entertainment, media, and breaking news 24/7. If it’s news, we’re on it.”
The website lacks transparency as they do not claim to have a political orientation, despite the entirety of the content being conservative. They also do not mention that the website was founded by Michelle Malkin.
Funded by / Ownership
Twitchy is owned by Townhall Media, an affiliate of Salem Media Group. Townhall Media properties includes Townhall, RedState, Hot Air, Bearing Arms, and Townhall Finance, all of which are rated right biased. Revenue is derived from online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Twitchy does not produce original content, but rather provides conservative commentary around tweets. Headlines are often sensationalized to denigrate the left such as this: Biden campaign reminds top donors to ‘dig deep’ so Joe can keep chartering jets to run for president and warn people about climate change. This story links to a variety of Twitter users and the New York Times. The stories published on Twitchy always favor the right and routinely mock the left. When it comes to sourcing they usually cite conservative Twitter accounts such as from Breitbart or the NRA. They also source completely unknown Twitter users. The bottom line is Twitchy is only as accurate as the tweets they are sharing, which includes President Trump, who often tweets falsehoods. This is essentially a right wing propaganda website.

Liberty Unyielding also republishes from other sources such as the factually Mixed Daily Caller. They also have a section called the LU Web Crawler, which links to conservative news stories from a wide range of credible sources such as The Hill, Washington Post, Rasmussen and sometimes Questionable sources such as Breitbart and Life News. Lastly, the website features a blog roll of other right biased sources such as Hot Air and Newsbusters. In general, Liberty Unyielding presents news with a strong right wing conservative bias and occasionally uses poor sources.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check. Liberty Unyielding is listed on Zimdars’ fake news list, which does not make sense as they have not failed a fact check. This appears to be an unfair characterization that lacks evidence.

Analysis / Bias
In review, Futurism publishes news and information related to science and cutting edge or future technologies. Articles often use minimal to moderate loaded language such as this: Deepfake Pioneer: “Perfectly Real” Fake Vids Are Six Months Away, This story like all others is properly sourced to either scientific papers or credible news media outlets such as CNBC and Technology Review. The website also features a section called “The Byte” where they take an article from another publication and summarize it such as this: THIS SITE TURNS WIKIPEDIA PAGES INTO FAKE ACADEMIC PAPERS. Politically, Futurism reports only when it pertains to their genre. A search for articles on “Trump” shows relatively neutral language that avoids adding significant opinions.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

History
Founded in 2012, The London Economic is a website that covers news about politics, entertainment, business, breaking news, and health. The founder is Jack Peat who is a business and economics journalist who has also written for the Telegraph and BBC News. According to their about page “We support liberal, progressive, pro-European and pro-business viewpoints and look to counter the spread of far-right rhetoric dominating the mainstream media.” 
Funded by / Ownership
The London Economic is part-owned by news agency South West News Service. Revenue is generated through advertising and donations.
Analysis / Bias
In review, The London Economic has a strong left wing bias in story selection that always favors the left. They consistently use loaded headlines such as: Leaked list of Conservative Party sex pest sleaze published, shaming THIRTY SIX current Tory MPs  and this Boris Johnson turns into The Joker in new artwork. While The London Economic mentions their source in articles, they do not provide hyperlinks for further verification of information, which leads to articles being spun and taken out of context.
Editorially, there is consistent liberal bias such as this The Conservatives are taking a sledge hammer to their voter base and this Labour is the only party treating both sides of the Brexit divide with respect. In general, news reporting is mostly factual, but lacks hyperlinked sourcing, while editorial positions always favor the left.

In another article covering Hungarian right-wing, populist Prime Minister Victor Orban, Emerging Europe appears to be neutral “Viktor Orbán meets the press.” They also publish opinion pieces such as “Poland’s Law and Justice party should be banned”, which is critical of Poland’s Law and Justice party (PIS) ( Poland’s right wing populist national conservative party).

These sources are generally trustworthy for information, but may require further investigation. See all Left-Center sources.

History
Founded in 2013, Emerging Europe is an online news website based in London, which focuses on economics, business and politics. They also publish a quarterly magazine which focuses mostly on business issues related to Central and Eastern European countries. Emerging Europe’s about page does not mention when and who founded it and who funds it.  Emerging Europe’s readership is geared towards business owners and investors. The editor-in-chief is Craig Turp-Balazs, however this is not prominently displayed. Further, this website completely lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership or funding. 
Read our profile on UK government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
Emerging Europe does not openly disclose ownership and funding. Andrew Wrobel is the “founding partner”of Emerging Europe and they list these companies as their partners. Revenue appears to be derived from advertising, however there may be other sources of funding that is not disclosed.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Emerging Europe uses emotionally loaded language covering politics such as “A new round of US sanctions against Russia could backfire.” A quote from the article reads “Combined with other external factors such as the change in global oil prices, the Russian economy saw a 2.8 per cent drop in GDP in 2015.” However, they don’t provide links to verify the claim. In another article covering Hungarian right-wing, populist Prime Minister Victor Orban, Emerging Europe appears to be neutral “Viktor Orbán meets the press.” They also publish opinion pieces such as “Poland’s Law and Justice party should be banned”, which is critical of Poland’s Law and Justice party (PIS) ( Poland’s right wing populist national conservative party). 
Emerging Europe covers immigrant related news with a neutral tone such as “Tension rises in emerging Europe as region prepares for new wave of migrants”.  There is no hyperlinking  in this article either. Emerging Europe covers global warming with a neutral tone such as “Budapest’s mayor declares climate emergency.” Further, they also advocate for left leaning positions regarding climate change such as this: It’s time for the EU to fully embrace the benefits of decarbonisation.
Emerging Europe utilizes credible sources such as Freedom House and the Institute of International Finance. When covering the U.S they use strongly emotionally loaded language such as “Six ways the US can repair its relationship with Ukraine.”  For example, a quote from the article reads “Despite Mr. Trump’s damaging actions, 2020 could (and should) be the year of a reinforced strategic relationship between the two countries.” Further, they frequently report negatively on USA President Donald Trump such as this: Donald Trump in bizarre attack on ‘aggressive’ Montenegro.
A factual search reveals they have not been fact checked by an IFCN fact checker.
Overall, we rate Emerging Europe Left-Center biased based on editorial and political positions that slightly favor the left. We also rate them Mostly Factual in reporting, rather than High due to a lack of transparency with ownership and limited sourcing of information. (M. Huitsing 3/8/2020)

History
The Pluralist is a news and opinion website that covers politics, the media and culture. According to their about page: “Pluralist is a tabloid that covers the U.S. culture wars. Our beat is the absurd, the hypocritical and the surreal. We try to counter conventional media narratives and get at what’s really at stake in the news.” According to the masthead the three founders are Juan Leon, Andrew Tobin and Adaam James Levin-Areddy.
Funded by / Ownership
The Pluralist is owned by Minute Media. They appear to be funded by an over-abundance of advertising that bogs down the website to a crawl. While we understand the need for advertising to survive (we do it), there are limits and they exceed them. Ad Blocker blocked 18 ads on one article. Again, ads are essential and I do not personally use my ad blocker because I want the media to remain free and for sites to make money, but this is a bit much and a burden to the viewer.

History
Quartz, was launched by the Atlantic Media Co., in 2012, as a global business news outlet. In 2017, Atlantic Media Co., sold its majority stake in The Atlantic to Emerson Collective, owned by Laurene Powell Jobs. In 2018, Atlantic Media sold Quartz to the Japanese business intelligence and media company, Uzabase Inc.

Quartz focuses on global economics coverage, provides business information and analysis and news, commentary, lifestyle and more. They also have a charting platform called Atlas.
Zachary Seward is Quartz’s chief product officer and executive editor. Jay Lauf is the publisher and CEO of Quartz. Kevin J. Delaney is editor-in-chief and co-president of Quartz and they both report to Uzabase and NewsPicks (business news aggregation app) Founder and CEO Yusuke Umeda.  Quartz’s main office is located in New York City.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
The current owner of Quartz is Uzabase Inc. and NewsPicks founder, Yusuke Umeda. Uzabase, runs a business news aggregation app called NewsPicks (in 2017, NewsPicks made a Business Alliance with Dow Jones & Company, Inc.). The NewsPicks app allows readers to share articles along with their opinions and comments, however according to a Japan Times interview with Umeda “Reading and commenting are free. But unlike many firms that rely on revenue from online ads, NewsPicks’ ad revenue comes from publishing sponsored articles.” He also states “The company’s focus now is on how to increase paying subscribers” Uzabase also operates the financial business intelligence service called Speeda.
Jay Lauf, describes quartz’ business model as “a native advertising formula grounded in editorial values.” Although access to Quartz main site is currently free, in November 2018, they launched a paid membership program which includes “events, exclusive content and regular conference calls with Quartz staffers.” Quartz calls these member exclusive articles and titles “interactive.“
Analysis / Bias
In review, Quartz’s content mainly consist of large images, charts, and/or graphs. Quartz publishes stories with neutral headlines such as “To understand Trump’s speech, look at the US-Mexico border as it exists today”, as well as strong emotionally loaded language such as “A living glossary of all the words you need to understand the Trump presidency.”  A quote from the article reads “Trump is seen as the editor-in-chief of the fake news movement because of his disregard of facts, such as when he claimed in a recent tweet, with no supporting evidence, that millions voted illegally in the US election.” When it comes to sourcing, they typically utilize credible sources such as c-span.org, New York Times, Huffington Post, and USA Today.
Editorially, Quartz does not endorse any political party, however their sister publication, The Atlantic endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Presidential elections. Further, Quartz does not have a favorable view of President Trump with consistent negative articles pertaining to his administration: Another scandal-ridden member of Trump’s cabinet is resigning. Lastly, Quartz is generally pro-science with its reporting on GMO’s and Climate Change.

Notes: Launched in November 2011, Wings Over Scotland is a Scottish commentary political blog founded by activist and long term supporter of Scottish Independence, Stuart Campbell.
First, we need to look at the political parties that favor and oppose Scotland’s independence: “Scottish independence is supported most prominently by left leaning parties such as the Scottish National Party (SNP), but the Scottish Green Party, the Scottish Socialist Party also favors Scottish Independence. On the other hand, The Conservative Party, Labour Party, Liberal Democrats, UK Independence Party (UKIP), and the British National Party (BNP) oppose Scottish independence.”
According to the Wings Over Scotland about page their main focus is on media and they also offer commentary and analysis. Wings Over Scotland publicly supported a YES vote on a referendum for Scottish Independence.
In review, Wings Over Scotland uses loaded words that typically favor Nationalist left-center political views on headlines and articles such as: “Fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake”, “The Great Whiteout” and “Our Friends In Europa.” Wings Over Scotland does not source well. Typically, they source directly to themselves, only occasionally using credible media such as The Independent and BBC, but typically they use these sources as a means to criticizing them for their coverage of Scottish Independence. Due to a lack of sourcing we did a factual search to determine if they have ever failed a fact check. The factual search reveals they have not failed any fact checks. Overall, we rate Wings Over Scotland Left-Center Biased due to political positions and stories that favor the left. Despite using limited sourcing, we rate the High for factual reporting based on having a clean fact check record. (M. Huitsing 1/26/2018)

Analysis / Bias
In review, the Raleigh News and Observer covers local news through journalists with minimal bias such as this: 3 men face charges in heroin bust as suspect escapes, causes wrecks in Chapel Hill. National and world news often comes from the Associated Press.
Editorially, the Raleigh News and Observer moderately favors the left through presidential endorsements that have always picked Democrats since at least 1980. Further, op-eds tend to favor the left as well such as this: Trump’s callous food aid cuts? NC is already there, though there are right leaning opinions present within this paper.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded in 2014, Conservative Review claims on their website that they “provide best-in-class analysis and commentary on conservative political speech, votes, positions, and elections.” In October 2016, Conservative Review launched CRTV, an online television network, with shows by Mark Levin, Michelle Malkin, Steven Crowder, Mark Steyn, Gavin McInnes, Steve Deace, and Matt Kibbe. Steyn’s show was cancelled in February 2017. Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson joined the lineup in October 2017. Eric Bolling joined the lineup in summer 2018. The Website’s Editor-in-Chief is Mark Levin, who has a poor track record with facts.

Funded by / Ownership
Conservative Review is owned by Mark Levin and its parent company CRTV LLC. The website is funded through minimal advertising and CRTV through a paid subscription model.
Analysis / Bias
In review, the website presents original content written by Mark Levin, and staff, as well as links to other news outlets. Original content uses moderately loaded words that almost always favors the right. Example: Levin: Want to see REAL campaign finance violations? Look at these creeps in Congress. New content that is linked to other sources typically comes from right leaning sources such as The Federalist and factually mixed sources such as the Daily Wire and The Blaze.
Conservative Review is best known for their Liberty Score, in which they rate politicians on their conservative voting records. The Liberty Score has been used widely and is occasionally used to aid in fact checking.
It is not possible to accurately review CRTV as it consists of multiple opinion based radio hosts. What we do know is the majority of the hosts have failed fact checks via IFCN fact checkers. For example, Michelle Malkin has an extensive record of failed fact checks and misleading claims.
Overall, we rate Conservative Review Right Biased based on conservative political positions and Mixed for factual reporting due to use of poor sources and radio personalities who have poor records with fact checkers. (7/18/2016) Updated (D. Van Zandt 8/23/2018)

Country: USA
World Press Freedom Rank: USA 48/180
History
Founded by Sky Palma in 2012, DeadState is a left leaning online news and opinion website. According to their about page “Without resorting to clickbait and misinformation, DeadState highlights both the absurdity and triumphs of people, politics, current events, religion, and the overall human condition from an unapologetically secular progressive perspective.” 
Sky Palma is also the editor of Being Liberal, which we rate Left Biased and High for factual reporting as well.

Analysis / Bias
In review, DeadState reports news and opinion with a liberal bias in reporting. Most stories favor the left and some use moderately loaded words such as this: Twitter points out the irony of Sarah Sanders telling Democrats to ‘quit lying’. This story is properly sourced to USA Today. Another example of loaded language can be found here: Anti-LGBT Republican resigns after accusations he used gay dating app to meet way-younger men. This story is also properly sourced. Editorially, DeadState usually favors the Left and reports negatively on the right. In particular, DeadState is not a fan of President Trump: Christians finally condemn Trump’s racist rally — because he said ‘Goddamn’ and Former RNC Chairman: Christian ‘phonies’ sold out for ‘thirty pieces of silver’ under Trump. It should be noted that a lot of DeadState’s content comes from a secular perspective, which by default places them left in our current political system, which some may argue is not accurate.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.

History
Launched in 2013 by former Mitt Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades, former RNC spokesman Tim Miller, and former RNC research director and current America Rising CEO Joe Pounder, America Rising PAC is a GOP research group, which describes its purpose on their about page as “exposing the truth about Democrats through video tracking, research, and strategic communications.” Ballotpedia reports that they provide opposition research to paying clients. America Rising is a PAC, which means they “have a $5,000 per person cap on donations and cannot accept money from corporations or unions.”
They are based in Arlington, Virginia and currently, Sarah Dolan is the Executive Director of America Rising.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
America Rising PAC does not provide information regarding revenue on the website.
Desmogblog reports “America Rising PAC had a budget of $8 million for 2014.” This revenue comes from donations and due to their 501(c)4 nonprofit status they do not have to disclose its donors. The HuffPost reports “Most of its operating revenue will come from clients -– federal party committees, state parties, candidate campaigns, super PACs -– that want the group’s information and are willing to pay for it. America Rising has set itself up to be run like a private enterprise.”
A review of Open Secrets lists some of their top donors as: Paul Singer, Linda McMahon, Hedge-fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin, a self-described “Reagan Republican”, Health insurance executive Mike Fernandez, who became a billionaire in the HMO business before becoming a major Republican donor.
Analysis / Bias
In review, America Rising publishes research on Democratic candidates and politicians. This research tends to be republished articles from other sources. For instance, under the “Research” tab they published this story from the strongly right biased RedState: Joe Biden’s Past Abortion Comments Draw Devastating Headlines and Fury from the Left. Under the “Take Action” tab they display voting surveys and petitions that favor the right. Under the “news” tab they republish news articles that are not favorable to Democrats. They use a wide range of sources such as the left leaning Washington Post and right leaning Washington Free Beacon.
In 2017, America Rising, through its lawyer, sought e-mails of career employees of the Environmental Protection Agency who criticized President Donald Trump or EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The e-mail requests provoked fears of political retribution and was described by critics as a “witch hunt.”
Although they do not report favorably on environmental protection and regulation, a factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate America Rising PAC Right Biased based on story selection and political advocacy that always favors the Republican Party. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to a clean fact check record. (M. Huitsing 6/19/2019)

Finnish News is owned by English/Finnish journalist Nicholas Anderson. The website does not appear to have a source of revenue.
Analysis / Bias
In their own words, they describe their view as “We have a strong Nordic viewpoint – one which respects democracy, the rule of law, sustainable and transparent policies.”
In review, when covering national news they use moderately loaded language in their headlines such as this “This Week in Politics – True Finns Are Not True.” In the body of this article they fact check the True Finns Party (nationalistic populist right wing party of Finland) and strongly criticize them with this quote “His shadow budget is an interesting mix of nationalistic fanciful thinking that would never happen if they got elected into government, but it is colorful enough to win over bigoted voters.”
When covering international news pertaining to the UK they use emotionally loaded language in their headlines such as “Boris is Not Churchill & Not Great for UK, and when covering the USA they have a strong anti-Trump tone such as this: “Trump was Extremely Rude to the Finnish President.“ Finally, when it comes to sourcing they do not provide hyperlinks to the sources they reference such as the New York Times. As a web only publication it is expected that hyperlinks be provided for the reader to check the claims of the author.
A factual search reveals they have not been fact checked by an IFCN fact checker.
Overall, we rate Finnish News Left Biased based on story selection and editorial positions that usually favor the left. We also rate them Mostly Factual for reporting, rather than High due to not providing hyperlinked sourcing on a web only blog. (M. Huitising 01/05/2020)

History
FiveThirtyEight, sometimes referred to as 538, is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging. The website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college, was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver.
In 2013, ESPN became owner of FiveThirtyEight and in April 2018 the site was acquired by ABC News.
Read our profile on United States government and media.
Funded by / Ownership
FiveThirtyEight is owned by ABC News, which in turn is owned by the Walt Disney Company. The website is funded through online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, FiveThirtyEight is different from other polling sources in that they do not conduct the polls, but rather deeply analyze other polls and apply a strict methodology to determine accuracy. For example, Real Clear Politics simply takes the averages of all polls to come up with a score, whereas 538 uses weights on each individual poll based on demographics and much more. One can argue this is more accurate and 538’s early track record proved it was. However, in 2016 they gave President Trump a 29% chance of winning. This does not mean they were wrong, because they still had a 29% chance of being correct, but they clearly were not very close on this one with their methods.
538 also reports news on their website that tends to lean left, however, they have been criticized as being opposed to the progressive left. News articles typically utilize moderate to minimal loaded language such as this: How Amy Klobuchar Could Win The 2020 Democratic Nomination. This article relies on proper sourcing from the likes of ABC News, Monmouth University and Senate.gov. A review of news stories reveals a more positive tone toward the left such as this: Trump Is Wrong. When The Opposition Party Runs The House, The President Gets Investigated.
In general, 538 tends to stick to poll related news, but when discussing politics, they usually slightly favor the left through story selection and wording.
A factual search reveals that FiveThirtyEight has never failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate FiveThirtyEight (538) Left-Center Biased based on story selection that slightly favors the left, but does not favor the progressive left. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing of information, a solid record with poll analysis and a clean fact check record. (D. Van Zandt 5/16/2016) Updated (2/12/2019)

Analysis / Bias
In 2019, Reporters Without Borders ranked India 140/180 in their Press Freedom Index. According to The Wire “most newspapers in India would be completely unprofitable were it not for government advertising and other kinds of rent that they are able to collect. Bloomberg reports “India’s Government spent $640 million on advertisements.” Therefore, it is crucial for media to be close to the ruling government.
In review, Catch News publishes articles with emotionally loaded language and with critical Narendra Modi tone (Current Prime Minister and right-wing nationalist party BJP leader) such as “Narendra Modi’s Republic of Fear” and “Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Statue Of Unity: Modi Ji, instead upon the statue, here’s how you could have used Rs 3000 crore.”
The Economic Times India reports that due to its political ideology (The group that owns Catch News as well as its sister publication, Rajasthan Patrika), Patrika claimed a sharp decline in government advertisements with a quote that reads “both display and classified ads issued by the state had dipped to all-times lows and this was affecting its circulation too.”
Recently however, the tone is more neutral towards PM Modi, such as this republished story from ANI news agency “PM Modi plants saplings in Parliament as part of plantation drive.” 
When it comes to sourcing, Catch News often hyperlinks to itself as well as republishes articles from Indian news agencies such as ANI news agency and PTI (The Press Trust of India Ltd.). Further, they occasionally publish sensational stories under the section “Bizarre news” which is poorly sourced and consists of click bait headlines: “Believe it or not! Watch how raw chicken jumps out of dish prepared at restaurant; netizens left shocked!”
When covering world news pertaining to the USA, they cover the Trump administration with relatively neutral tone such as this: “US President Donald Trump presents Pakistan PM Imran Khan a cricket bat at White House”.

History
Launched in 1976, The Citizen is a South African tabloid style daily newspaper, which is distributed mainly in Gauteng. The Citizen was founded by South African Business magnate and the former president of the South African Rugby Football Union, Louis Luyt. According to a Haaretz article, Luyt was given money by the government to establish The Citizen. A quote from the article reads “The publisher was Luyt, and he got the money secretly from the government.”
The Citizen focuses on news, business, sport, lifestyle, parenting, entertainment, motoring, horse racing, gaming and auctions. Trevor Stevens is the Editor.
Funded by / Ownership
The Citizen is owned by one of the four big media corporations in South Africa, Caxton & CTP publishers & printers. Mr. Terrence D. Moolman is the co-founder of Caxton & CTP publishers & Printers. The Citizen generates revenue through advertising and subscriptions.
Analysis / Bias
According to I Media Ethics, The Citizen apologized for Photoshopping an Agence France-Presse picture. Further, The Citizen issued an apology to Anton Harber for an article about Winnie Mandela’s Stratcom allegations.
In review, when publishing world news, The Citizen republishes articles from the least biased AFP, such as “Iran accuses US of ‘unacceptable’ escalation in tensions.” When it comes to publishing national political news, The Citizen utilizes moderately emotionally loaded headlines such as this, The mayor alludes that Ramaphosa is a charmer who plays around with people’s emotions. This article is critical of the ANC. The ANC (The African National Congress) is a South African political party which has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa and also a member of Socialist International. For more details on South African Government and Media influence click here: South Africa Government and Media.
In another article there is positive bias regarding the opposition party, “Maimane survives as DA leadership takes collective responsibility”  (Maimane is the the leader of DA – The Democratic Alliance Party- the party is regarded as center-right in economic policy). When sourcing, The Citizen utilizes other South African media sources such as The Sowetan and The African News Agency (ANA), which is a syndicated, multimedia news and content distribution service.
A factual search reveals they have not failed a fact check.
Overall, we rate The Citizen, Right-Center biased based on story selection and editorial content that moderately favors the right. We also rate them High for factual reporting due to reasonable sourcing and a clean fact check record. (M. Huitsing 5/17/2019) Updated (12/24/2019)

History
According to their about page: “Washington Press is a news website dedicated to providing our readers the most accurate, concise, and breaking political news of the day. In an age of fake news, we are a trusted source with a track-record of honesty and integrity.” Colin Taylor is listed as the Managing Editor of Washington Press.
Funded by / Ownership
The about page does not list who owns the website. Funding appears to primarily come from online advertising.
Analysis / Bias
In review, Washington Press presents news with a borderline extreme left wing bias that always favors the left and is always anti-Trump and the political right. There is frequent and very strong use of loaded words in both headlines and articles such as this: “Trump just declared war on the First Amendment in an unhinged cabinet meeting.” The Washington Press usually sources their information to credible mainstream media outlets, however they sometimes use poor sources such as Shareblue, which has a mixed record with fact checking. The Washington Press has also failed fact checks that can be found here and here.

History
FaithWire is a news and opinion website dedicated to Christian Conservative news. FaithWire was launched by the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 2016, which we rate as a Conspiracy-Pseudoscience source. It should be noted they are run independently of CBN and is focused more on news content.
Read our country media profile of the USA.
Funded by / Ownership
Faithwire is owned by the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), which was founded by Televangelist Pat Robertson in 1961. Pat Robertson has been known to make controversial and false claims throughout his long television career.
Analysis / Bias
In review, all articles favor right leaning positions such as support for pro-life, anti-gay marriage, creationism and most other political positions affiliated with Christian conservatism. FaithWire uses minimal loaded words in their articles and for the most part uses credible sourcing. Faithwire is strongly pro-Trump as evidenced by this article: President Trump Gives Encouraging Pro-Life Speech, Cites This Powerful Bible Verse. 
Overall, we rate FaithWire right biased based on story selection and political affiliation. Further, we rate them mixed for factual reporting based on promoting anti-science positions. (D. Van Zandt 10/30/2017) Updated (D. Van Zandt 11/25/2019)
